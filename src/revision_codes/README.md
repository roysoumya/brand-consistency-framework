## Current revision codes
Here, we add the codes related to the new experiments related to the "Sentence Ranking Tool" (Section 6). The changes made are as follows : 
1. We added more elaborately explained the  ground truth creation process and task definition of the helper tool. 
2. We have added more evaluation metrics like \textit{Precision@1,2 and 3}. 


### Adding evaluation metrics

We first add the Jupyter notebooks corresponding to the computation of the new evaluation metrics of Precision@1, Precision@2 and Precision@3.
