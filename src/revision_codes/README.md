## Current revision codes
Here, we add the codes related to the new experiments related to the "Sentence Ranking Tool" (Section 6). The changes made are as follows : 
1. We added more elaborately explained the  ground truth creation process and task definition of the helper tool. 
2. We have added more evaluation metrics like \textit{Precision@1,2 and 3}. 
3. We also add the statistical significance tests of paired t-test done.

### Adding evaluation metrics
File : computePrecisionRecallF1scores_27thJune.ipynb

We first add the Jupyter notebooks corresponding to the computation of the new evaluation metrics of Precision@1, Precision@2 and Precision@3.

### Adding statistical significance tests
File: rouge_score_pvalue.ipynb and Rcodes/stat_test_10thJuly.R

It contains the codes to reproduce the statistical significance test results.
