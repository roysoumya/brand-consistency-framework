This year, SHC partnered with , and to marry four couples on our float during the parade. Over a million people cheered on our Shop Your Way Pride Wedding Contest winners as the parade traveled through the city neighborhoods. I was joined by dozens of SHC associates and family members who marched in the parade or cheered from the crowd. It was a moving day for all involved as this was the first parade since the Illinois Marriage Equality Law was enacted. As a company that represents a true cross section of America, Sears Holdings gives more to our members no matter who they are or who they love. Thank you to everyone who participated and supported our couples on their special day. In addition, I also proud to report that out of nearly 200 entries, small businesses, non-profit organizations and corporate sponsored floats, our Gift Registry float won the Business Float.

Maybe this used to make sense when we could rely on a traditional sales funnel to market to that would become sales prospects down the road. But the process is not that linear anymore. Creating a successful Xerox Managed Print Service (MPS) practice involves some diligence and a series of logical elements that involve market research, vendor selection and sales strategy.

The feedback from them is that not only is Xerox back but it is actually focussed on opportunities that are really enhancing our customers' ability to manage their document infrastructure much more efficiently. So I think that we are definitely on the upswing. Personalisation is absolutely necessary in communication. And I am not talking about names and addresses, it's content personalisation. It is really understanding the data and the information that people have about their customers and using that to drive much more efficient communications and interactions with customers. That's huge. Colour represents a third of our revenues today. It is another emerging opportunity here and I think that we can drive colour adoption at a faster rate. And then obviously services.

Documents can also be signed electronically, saved, and uploaded to cloud storage (Dropbox, Box, Office365, OneDrive for Business etc.). The Xerox Mobile Link App has a high degree of customization, creating icons on the home screen so that users can repeat desired workflows with one touch.

ARM was a popular platform, and software-defined networks (SDNs) generated significant buzz (as reported by Charlie Ashton on ), along with FPGAs, which give companies more fle to create differentiated products and speed time to market. Discussions also surfaced around these questions: It was gratifying to see members of this segment embracing new architectures and new ways of looking at age-old issues like processors in the data center and complex networking applications. It was also e to see the interest in HMC taking hold now that it really tangible. It hard to believe that only two years ago, the was just getting off the ground. Today, the HMCC has more than 100 adopters and a specification that available to the public.

When you look at the future of diversity in America, it is important that people of diverse background are able to find their place in America. Diversity is about so much more than the color of one skin or ethnicity. Diversity and inclusion are about ensuring that everyone has a seat at the table and that their viewpoints are taken into consideration and their voices are encouraged.

But across Europe, an ageing population is costing health services more money 80% of the care we need in our lives is required after were 65 and budgets are shrinking rather than e. Fortunately many efficiency improvements can also improve patient outcomes and one that can do just that is the electronic health record (EHR).;Weve come to trust the paper record in healthcare. But records take a long time to fill out, writing is often illegible, paper is easily lost, and incomplete or poor records can cause error.;Whats more, while some countries, notably the UK with its Summary Care Record, are working to make records available to all clinics, at the moment, when someone presents to a new clinic or hospital, staff are unlikely to have access to their records. And, if the person is elderly, they may not be able to provide any insight into their condition. The EHR tackles this issue by providing a secure record of each patients history at the point of care to improve treatment. Whats more, the record can red flag issues such as allergies to prevent prescribing errors.;To date, major EHR programmes have had a patchy record. But technology is changing all the time and the core pieces of an EHR system are now relatively simple to install. My five steps to think about when planning an electronic records system include:;The downscaling of the EUs ambitious Single eHealth Areaproject and the initial problems that the UKs National Care Record system faced have raised concerns about the viability of EHRs. But the technology is very robust and proven now, and weve seen partners create cloud systems for care records that are easy to deploy. The lessons from the US suggest that the best approach is to create a national spine of basic data and then link this with regional bodies that have the freedom to build their own systems. This creation of smaller discrete components simply makes EER projects much more manageable.;This approach provides a good starting point for building EHRs that will slash costs; improve the quality of care a win for both clinicians and their patients.;Also driving new standards in patient safety is the movement towards standardised barcode scanning.

With the Sears Catalog, it was the nation pioneer in providing what we call today an integrated marketplace for everything from automobiles to fine china. But the retail landscape has changed significantly over the past decade. We are proud of our legacy but we also recognize the need to adapt, innovate and transform . Like many other things that have been impacted by emerging and mobile technologies, customers shopping behavior has dramatically changed in the past few years as well. Customers are more informed than ever. Access to product information is easy, comparing prices across retailers is a few clicks away and, researching products and using that knowledge to influence their purchases has become the norm. Mobile phones have made it even easier to get access to this information at the point of purchase. We saw this shift early on and understood how these changes could impact a traditional business model. That why we have been so focused on Integrated Retail, which means leveraging our strengths our associates, physical stores, online and mobile capabilities, the Shop Your Way membership program, and a robust supply chain to provide our members with the ease of shopping online and the physical aspect of shopping in store. Retail is a competitive business, impacted even more so by online-only retailers that don have fi costs like traditional brick and mortar retailers do. They also have lot more fle with technology investments that enable them to e a very dynamic business model without the constraints and challenges of legacy systems. We don think in terms of store investments versus online investments because in many ways one complements the other. Rather, investing in online allows us to bring those digital capabilities into our stores, and investing in our stores makes inventory and fulfillment options available to our members online. Our online and mobile investments are part of the shopping eco-system, with Shop Your Way at the core of the transformation. Transforming Sears Holdings from a company focused on running stores and selling products to a company focused on serving members across any channel (stores, online, mobile) is not easy and it doesn happen overnight. It a journey. It also a challenge that many of us at Sears Holdings have taken upon ourselves and are e to tackle. I am fortunate to work every day with a talented team that is creative, passionate and determined to figure out ways to provide our members with the best possible integrated retail e in our stores. We have built or enhanced capabilities such as: We have lot more work to do but we are encouraged to see the growth in areas where we are investing. I look forward to sharing more with you as we build these capabilities. Our focus has been, and continues to be on what matters the most innovating around our members and our customers.

For e, you have one NetScaler Gateway virtual web server that uses the same URL that leverages GSLB and you want to use the same FIPS SSL certificate between the two virtual servers.

To be sure, the push toward greater organizational adoption of BYOD (bring your own device) policies and procedures is a major component of most comprehensive mobile-technology implementation strategies. Which is why the article, , courtesy of the on IT series on Spiceworks.com, is particularly timely. The author is an IT manager who was tasked with building-out his agency BYOD infrastructure. In the Spiceworks article he provides a helpful overview of his thought process, and gives specific advice for how to work with e IT systems to develop a suitable BYOD solution. He also touches on the differences between getting the technology right and ensuring proper end-user adoption and compliance. From the piece: took one weekend, and only about 10 hours total, to reconfigure everything to support BYOD access. The policies took longer they always do because we needed to educate people on what it means to access corporate resources in a healthcare environment. We had to deal with apps that didn work particularly well in 4-inch doses ( E on your phone is still the worst joke ever told). We had to deal with increased traffic patterns. We had to deal with personal laptops riddled with malware (blocking them from access is easy e why is harder). We had to e that we reserved the right to fully wipe any personal device used to access company data or apps if it ever goes missing. The author then lists three key areas of focus, based on his e, for others to consider when undertaking a similar BYOD rollout: For further elaboration on those three points, and to read more about the author e, I encourage you to read the article in its entirety.

We have seen new processes in everything from the parts in our vehicles to the way we approach our service calls each day. To say this has been a challenge is an understatement. Don Stephens is a senior customer service engineer in his 30th year with Xerox. When he isn repairing high-volume printers, Don is a blogger, an author and a freelance writer. Technicians are resistant to change, but not for the reasons you might think. Here are three reasons why I believe that field service reps react to change less than favorably at times. In order to be successful in field service, we must develop good work habits. We are on our own 99 percent of the time, and the temptation to goof off weeds out those who can work on their own in the first year. New processes mean changing tried and true habits that we have come to rely on. Sometimes it can be like reinventing the wheel by adding square edges or at least it feels that way. We want to see the corporation succeed, we really do, but when we hear, is the direction the company is heading period we tend to bristle and dig in our heels. Because A leads to B, which in turn leads to C in our minds, we to be given the whole picture. Most of the time this is provided, but occasionally we are left to scratch our heads and wonder where we are headed as a company. (Oh and we rarely have time to sort through our email for the one that has e it in great detail. If our manager hasn gone over it, then we are still dragging our feet.) Tech reps: Creatures of habit, practical, and suspicious. Here why. http:/ctt.ec/NcgdQ+ #FieldService pic.twitter.com/D7wvYsTdRT I was told by a team member my first week on the job that, you don like something about the company, then wait six months it will be gone by then. Most of the service force has 20-plus years. Having seen many programs come and go, (some of which only lasted a brief time for good reasons) we are understandably hesitant when ne big revolution comes along. We sit back and watch to see if it is going to be a flash in the pan or something that is here to stay. When we are satisfied that the change is permanent, we jump on board and try to enjoy the ride. Occasionally our skeptical side rears up with a new process and we dig in our heels; even if it makes perfect sense and is good for the company and our jobs. You might have to pull on the reins a bit. But please pull gently we are a sensitive lot too. and receive email updates when we publish a new article.

Nothing can be further from the truth. Effectively managing and improving the operating performance of our apparel business is one of Sears Holdings top priorities in 2016, as our Chairman and CEO Eddie Lampert recently . Our apparel business has a substantial impact on the company overall profitability and is one of the keys to our efforts to generate positive Adjusted EBITDA in the near future. Specifically, we are dedicated to having the right product assortment for our members, the right sourcing strategy and a deep, e set of leaders in place to positively impact this business. Our members and customers tastes change quickly and we need to better match their shopping behaviors and interest in fresh assortment by focusing on several key brands from Kmart and Sears. As part of this shift, will continue to reduce the number of overall brands and product categories while working to elevate the product. We are proud of our members response to the new styles of various brands, such as: It vital that we offer our members and customers the right fashion at the right time at the right price. We will continue to become less reliant on partner brands, and more focused on getting stylish apparel to our members and customers through greater control over our supply chain. By leveraging better sourcing and a direct business approach, we anticipate that that the resulting cost improvements will have a direct result on margins and the price that the member pays. We have a strong leadership team in place to support the apparel business transformation. These are leaders with significant merchandising, design, sourcing and operational e at companies such as Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle, Hollister Co., Inditex, New Look, Primark and Victoria Secret. Additionally, we have leaders with successful, hands-on e in turning around businesses such as KIABI and Pimkie.

Although wireless wide area networks such as 3G or 4G are now available in most urban areas, Wi-Fi is still preferred in most cases due to wide support of all sort of devices and the fact that you can get free connection now in most public places, including bars/restaurants, airports, hotels, city centers, stadium etc. More importantly, most people now enjoy Wi-Fi at home and e the same e when they travel, leisure, work etc. It's fair to say that Wi-Fi has grown from being a niche technology used by companies in warehouses and other business environments to a commodity technology (available to almost everyone). ; So if Wi-Fi has now become commodity, does this mean that the same Wi-Fi technology that we use at home can be used in business environments as well? Not e. Even though we have standards for Wi-Fi products, which guarantee that an Access Point from vendor X works with a tablet from vendor Y, there are some important differences between products that are designed for personal use (or SOHO, Small Office / Home Office) and Enterprise Class solutions. While most people can imagine that a Wi-Fi network in a large hospital, university or retailer with hundreds of stores will have other requirements than the Wi-Fi you have at home, the differences may be less obvious for a Small or Medium Business (SMB). Especially when looking at the price of your little home router or AP, it may look attractive to buy the same products for your business. After all, it works at home, so why wouldn't it work at the office. Good question. Well, the answer is that at work (regardless the size of your business) you probably need an Enterprise Class solution. So then tell me what 'Enterprise Class' means, I hear you think. Basically it means that the solution is 'fit' for use in a professional business environment which then means it has specific features and options which supports your business better than a home or SOHO product.

While a little indulging every now and again wont make or break you diet, you can usually tell when youve gone a little overboard.;If you monopolized the cookies or hit the eggnog a little hard, its not too late to get back on track. Here are 6 things to focus on this week to help you start 2015 on the right foot:;We can never ; enough. Whether you need to re-hydrate after a night with too much champagne, or youve just been eating a lot of sodium, drinking water will help get you back at a good starting point. You dont need to guzzle it, but try having a glass when you wake up, before each meal and snack, and before you go to bed.;If youre planning to start a new workout regimen, or are just picking things back up after a slow season, now is a great time to take a look at what your goals are and reset them if needed. Last year we talked about how setting smaller goals can be more achievable, so maybe think about where youd like to be in three months rather than six and start from there. And your Fitbit goals count too! You can set a weight goal or step goals from the tiles on your ;.;Stock up on fruits, veggies, eggs, beans, and other healthy foods you love to reduce the temptation to keep indulging. Its much easier to cut back on sugar when there isnt any ; on hand to quench a craving. Try and eat light for a few days after indulging as well, or at least the first day after, to kick-start your recovery.;Maybe youre not up for it today, but get back into your desired workout routine as quickly as possible. Its easy to say tomorrow, so dont let that happen! You can even start with some of our ;.

The recognizes United States citizens who have achieved the required number of hours of service over a 12-month time period or cumulative hours over the course of a lifetime. The Lifetime Achievement award is for those who contribute more than 4,000 hours of service in their lifetime. Along with the ultimate honor of presidential recognition, recipients receive a personalized certificate, an official pin, medallion or coin a letter from the president of the United States. I currently manage two stores in Dayton, Ohio and have been working for Kmart for the past three years. I have been volunteering as far back as I can remember starting at school as a child. Whether it was in the library, during breaks or tutoring as requested, participating in school fundraisers and festivals annually, I was always involved.

I take great pride in recognizing and rewarding their milestones such as; recognizing them as official heroes in the cancer community; celebrating birthdays; recognizing the number of survival years since being diagnosed; or an anniversary of being cancer free. I often hear people say they wish they had the time or energy to help. But just as you do as a parent (proud mother of four), you make time and you put forth the energy. The reward you receive by helping others is much larger than money, a certificate or any other award. Seeing a smile from someone you helped, receiving a thank you, or a hug/handshake is in my opinion the highest level of achievement anyone can strive for, and that is why I do what I do. I want to be a better me, and giving back is my way of achieving that goal. I challenge you to make time to volunteer an hour each month. It will really inspire and humble you as it has for me.

A recent Xerox Thought Leadership Workshop delved into everything-direct marketing.

Digital has taken over or has it? While many of us choose to do significant amounts of our shopping online, how many actually prefer the e? It turns out not all that many at all, in fact 90% of people would rather buy from a physical store including myself if the mood takes me! This is reflected in the fact that physical sales still account for 89% of all retail purchases (in the UK);.;So what does this have to do with data? Well, it should come as no surprise that retailers are using big data to influence the digital customer e. But how often do you think about the impact that big data has on developing the e in-store as well?;Id never really considered it before, until one day, I was happily making my way around the supermarket, and it hit me! The influences were there, hiding in plain sight, yet I, like most, had walked by them, wilfully unaware of the data working behind the scenes, driving us to spend.;As I ventured deeper into the store, it became clear that some customers had already embraced the world of big data. Walking around with scanners in hand, these trend setters were scanning and bagging their purchases, as they shopped. By collecting the necessary data at the point of pick-up, these customers were streamlining their shopping e and assigning purchase data to their accounts in real-time.;I continued my journey into the belly of the retail beast, and everywhere I looked, I could see evidence of big datas influence. Everything from the canny promotion of paddling pools and sun cream on the hottest day of the year, to the placement of related products within an aisle, and the touchscreens providing meal inspirations. Everything appeared to ma my time in store as well increase my likelihood to buy.;As big data in the retail industry develops the infrastructure necessary to collect further information, the record of our behaviours in store will be broken down in greater detail through beacons, video cameras, facial recognition, RFID tags, guest Wi-Fi and a whole host of other data capture points. Used in the right way, retailer decision making and design will become increasingly customer centric.;With access to such rich data, my weekly shop is set to evolve at a faster pace than ever before. Ill walk around as ads customised to my personal interests attempt to grab my attention probably popping up on my phone or a nearby screen. Augmented reality e will add a new layer of communication and further enhance the retailers opportunities to communicate and sell, while touch screen interfaces will greet me with more product information than I could ever hope to ask for.

A recent Forbes article forecast the 7 marketing trends that would dominate 2014. Included were several Internet marketing practices, some of which may be impacted by recent changes to Google algorithm, known as Hummingbird. Research shows that using Twitter helps foster communication while promoting informal learning. Vladimir Gendelman, Founder and CEO of Company Folders, provides an overview of over 40 print-related Twitter accounts you want to follow all full of great content and helpful information. According to market research, most printing serves either to help sell a product or communicate information to someone. In that conte, there are three things that are impacting and changing the way print customers, and in turn, their customers use print and print related services. What determines the effectiveness of each marketing channel? Some people would argue that it pro. But there is another school of thought that says the effectiveness is determined by relevance and timing. In other words, getting the right message to the right person at the right time determines the effectiveness.

If you dont love what youre eating and feel restricted as so many do on a diet, youre not going to stick with it. My approach to cooking for weight loss is all about diet without deprivation. Combine that with 30 minutes of physical e and 10,000 steps or more a day, youre bound to see results.;As a chef, Im always surrounded by some of the most delicious food in the world. About 10 years ago, I started to see the effects of over-indulging in food begin to take a toll on my health. I had a real wake up call when my doctor told me about all the health consequences I was bound to face if I kept this lifestyle upI decided right then to change my perspective on food and have since dedicated the last 10 years of my life to proving the healthy and delicious are not mutually e. Ive since lost 41 pounds, kept it off, and competed in the Ironman 70.3 World Championship triathlon. I endured six hours of pure pain and I loved every bit of it!;Its so easy to eat mindlessly, grab handfuls of junk and just let the calories pile up. When you keep a running diary of the foods youve eaten in a day, youre e conscious of what you eat. No one wants to report that they ate a box of donuts in one sitting in front of the TV. Tracking your food intake is just another level of accountability.;Before I start working with each of my clients, I always recommend that they get a Fitbit tracker. Its an essential tool in my weight loss coaching. It helps my clients be more active and they feel proud when they can share the amazing goals theyve hit. Ive seen firsthand how tracking their fitness has contributed to their weight loss successes.;As for me, I wear a Fitbit every day and there is rarely a day where youll see me without mine. Im constantly traveling all over the country that its sometimes hard even for me to keep track of my own health.

Consumers are now time poor and information rich and retailers have to bow down to them, fulfilling their every need before they venture elsewhere.;Todays consumers not only have more power, but they also shop differently. They read reviews and compare prices online. They want to see merchandise on the shelves of your store, as well as the ability to order now and collect in store, and the ability to order now and get their goods delivered home. They e to find what theyre looking for, whatever theyre looking for and if they dont, they will go elsewhere. Meeting this demand for convenience is crucial to your business success, but it brings about challenges, too.;One of these challenges is understanding current-day supply and demand. In a 2013 Pierhouse survey of 250 consumers, 91% (the number one reason) admitted that they would leave a store if they couldnt find what they were looking for. Although bricks and mortar stores worry that e-retailers and showrooming where customers try things on in store and then buy online will take over, the truth is that there are customers out there, in physical stores, with their wallet open and have time to spend buying what they really want. Simply adapting, meeting and e the needs of consumers will ensure that they stay in store.;Another challenge is the monitoring of customer behaviour. With needs and demands constantly changing, e need to be acknowledged and predicted in a timely manner. For e, when retailers launched their Click & Collect service and located it within the store, it failed because consumers didnt want to go into the store to just pick up shopping. Now, retailers have listened to the consumers by bringing the click and collect service to the car park convenience.;Take the French supermarket chain, Leclerc, for e. It has more than 65 drive-through stores, enabling shoppers to order online 24/7 and collect 12 hours a day at a designated time by simply driving up to the kiosk and confirming their order. Staff will even place items directly into the boot of the car.;Companies like Leclerc are succeeding in todays marketplace, because they offer an unrivalled level of convenience to their customers. Theyre also prepared for customer demand, and are able to provide the products they say they will, when they say they will.;With RFID technology, combined with local knowledge and demographics forecasting, (for e, if theres a baby boom in your city, there will be a higher demand for nappies in a retirement hotspot, there wont), youll have greater visibility of stock youll need. Youll be able to create the ultimate smart inventory for stock in store and online, as well as click and collect purchases all in one place.;Adapting to the new customer DNA and having the product available will be one more reason for the consumer to stay in your store.;What are the difficulties that you face when bowing down to your customers? ; to find out how we could help you solve them, or you could visit our ; to see how Zebra has the perfect solution for you.; Topics: ;, ;, ;, ;, ;, ;, ;, ; '",zebra,3,11,110.125,0.2,-0.25,y,n,n,n,n,0.0079941868,-0.0338672202,-0.0556056124,-0.0650897343,-0.0084009395,3161,257,8.1303385005,54.6,n,n,y,y,y,4,3,5,1,2

While I am no e in the regulations that surround this, there is a requirement to provide inmates access to legal documents and educational classes. As these inmates do not have their own laptops (imagine that BYOD policy), DOC agencies set up computer labs and classrooms with devices for their use where they can access resources such as law libraries and GED courses.;The scenario I described above is a common scenario Ive seen with several states, and is the perfect use case for virtualization of applications such as the electronic law library from Le and Pearson VUE for GED testing. Using Citrix XenApp, these apps can be delivered to thin clients in prisons computer labs/classrooms across the state. Thin clients are a great fit here because they are low cost and easy to replace if (or when?) broken.;Prior to taking this approach, one specific DOC agency I work with had over 30 decentralized and individually ran computer labs in prisons across the state. Each prison managed their own law library with hardbound books that needed to be updated on an annual basis. After the decision was made to centralize all prison-related IT systems, they chose to implement Citrix XenApp and were able to centrally manage and deliver a standardized set of applications to all 30+ computer labs across the state. Initial cost savings were in e of $200k per year for the law libraries alone.;Its important to note that these Citrix sessions can be completely locked down via Citrix and Microsoft policies to prevent inmates from breaking out of the session and communicating with the outside world. On the Citrix side of the house, this is done via our Desktop Lock policy, which runs the application or desktop session in full-screen mode and prevents users from accessing other resources on that device (which are already minimized through the use of a thin client).

With a FIPS 140-2 Level 2 compliant Citrix NetScaler SDX, you can achieve security compliance and easily deploy ADC instances to meet your performance requirements. Whether you are a service provider hosting ADC instances for clients, or securing your businesses network, the NetScaler FIPS SDX makes your deployment secure, easy, and scalable to meet demands.;For the administrator, deploying the NetScaler FIPS SDX may appear to be a challenge in itself but I can assure you that it is not as difficult as it seems. Once you take a look at the underlying components of the FIPS SDX appliance, the process becomes a bit clearer. The purpose of this article is to highlight the architecture of the FIPS SDX and provide a step by step setup guide of the FIPS HSM and deployment of a NetScaler HA pair that is FIPS enabled.;An SDX is built on top of the XenServer hypervisor and utilizes a service VM (SVM) instance for overall management. Using this SVM, you can deploy, manage, and monitor NetScaler instances. The difference with the FIPS-compliant SDX is the addition of the Cavium Hardware Security Module (HSM). This is often referred to as the FIPS card or module and is where all private PKI keys are stored. The HSM is also where all SSL transactions are performed on a FIPS- enabled instance. The SDX also contains an SSL card that is used for non-FIPS processes and can be used in a hybrid mode to meet even higher processing demands. An important item to note is that every instance you deploy does not need to be FIPS enabled. This can be useful if you are hosting multiple tenants or just want to separate workloads you can have both types of instances on the same appliance.;This document reviews the steps required to configure the NetScaler SDX FIPS appliance, starting with the out of box initial configuration of the SDX and hardware security module (HSM) initialization. Sections detailing instance setup include the initial instance creation as well as a secondary instance for a high availability (HA) pair setup. NetScaler feature configuration steps are not covered in this document and are described in the product documentation.;After completing the steps in this setup guide, you should have a NetScaler HA pair that is FIPS enabled and is now ready for feature configuration to complete your deployment.;Follow me on Twitter ;Shane Smith is a NetScaler and Virtualization SME for the US Public Sector Consulting team and leads initiatives including FIPS compliance, SmartCard implementation, and Windows 10/Server 2016 deployments.

My dad always told me, become like the people you surround yourself with, so surround yourself with good people. remembered that. dad and I have always been close. Great dads continue to watch out for you no matter how old you get. My dad worked for a railroad company located in the Union Station building in downtown Chicago. I remember that he walked me over to the Sears Tower to make sure that I didn get lost getting to my first day of work at Sears. Following that, I had the good fortune to ride the train down to work with him every day until he retired and we moved to Hoffman Estates, Illinois. I blessed to still have him around to enjoy this Father Day! dad worked for American Airlines for almost 40 years. He taught me the value of hard work, helped form my love of travel and commercial aviation, modeled treating everyone with courtesy and respect and provided love and stability. Anything good I pass along to my kids finds its origin in him. dad was always coming up with creative ways to surprise me and my sister. I remember one Christmas I really wanted a Power Wheel car. When I came downstairs Christmas morning and walked into the living room, I was dismayed not to find one waiting for me. My dad said, guess Santa couldn fit it into the house. He then walked over to the fireplace and pointed to the end of a piece of string taped there with a little note saying me. The string led into the kitchen and all the way down into the basement/garage where the other end was tied to a shiny red power wheel. Obviously, I didn know my dad was responsible at the time but I have come to appreciate this and many other fond memories of my dad. love to tell people about my dad, as he was probably the most influential person in my life. My dad was a hard-working carpenter until the day he died at 71. This August will mark 10 years since he passed. Today would have been his 81st birthday. My entire childhood, he fi our family cars rather than taking them to a mechanic (and used many of Craftsman tools when doing so). He was also one who could easily say love you to his children, perhaps because he grew up without hearing those words from his own father. The ways in which he told us he loved us were numerous. When I left home to venture out on my own, it took on the form of asking me how my car was running. Every time I called him, even if it was on Father Day or his birthday (which was supposed to be all about him), one of the first things he would ask me is is your car running? What I heard each time he asked was, love you. dad enlisted in the Army Air Corp at the beginning of WWII. He was in WWII, the Korean War and Vietnam. He retired after 31 years, reaching the highest enlisted rank of Chief Master Sergeant. A leadership lesson I took from my dad, as a young Officer in the Army, was to set an e, remember who I was and that people are always watching when you are in a leadership position.

However, achieving this will be a tremendous challenge. Technology, by itself, can only do so much. ; How does Citrix make a difference?; Thats why we focus on ; and ;as priority areas. We engage with both IT and clinical leaders on a regular basis to understand and map clinical workflow pathways so that we can implement solutions that streamline clinical care without disrupting the day to day work of clinical staff. Our e in healthcare provides us with the ability to have granular conversations with clinicians across the care continuum because we understand that clinicians are not a homogeneous group. ;To emphasize this commitment, we also spend time assessing and integrating the latest NHS policy developments into the way we work both with trusts directly and through our partners. Whether its the recent Wachter Review and its focus on clinical engagement or the Caldicott Report and its focus on information governance, we are always adjusting to meet the needs of trusts. This means we can take a nuanced approach to how we deliver and implement our solutions according to the strategic plans of clinical IT leaders. It might mean supporting the delivery of a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) mobility strategy or implementing solutions that secure a trusts application ecosystem. ;A successful transformation process has to demonstrate tangible benefits. ; We understand that NHS trusts face both clinical and financial pressures. By engaging with clinical staff and understanding the strategic situations of individual trusts we can work together to build a benefits realisation roadmap based on the implementation of our solutions. This means quantitatively and qualitatively benchmarking e workflows so that we can forecast and later prove the benefits for end-users once our solutions have been deployed.;Dr Simon Irving, Consultant Acute Physician at Bolton NHS Foundation Trust captures this point eloquently, ;The new virtual desktop has made life so much easier as a consultant working in acute medicine. All applications run much, much quicker and I can quickly log in to the terminal closest to the patient I am treating.;The NHS has set out a clear set of objectives for its digital future that are based on mobility, accessibility and security. ; By focusing on people first, were demonstrating our commitment to being a long term partner for the NHS.;Matt Crawford drives market visibility and thought leadership for healthcare solution initiatives at Citrix.

Just as your associates have to adapt to customer behaviors, your learning infrastructure must be adaptable to support your associates. Content should be managed from a single source and updated based on factors like usage, buyer reaction, sales or net promoter scores.

For the Lufthansa Group, 2017 is dedicated to this theme. On January 10th, at the Digital Aviation Forum in Frankfurt, we presented the digital portfolio of our group to decision makers, the media, and our customers.;Digitalization can result in major increases in efficiency. Chatbots digital advisors based on artificial intelligence noticeably lighten the load of our service centres. Our customers benefit from shorter hold times.

With over 100 million passengers per year, how can we use the increasing number of customer interactions and the resulting data streams to make even better decisions? The keyword here is big data. We can use customer analytics and artificial intelligence to deduce customer preferences and to personalize and optimize our guests travel e.;There is another level of digitalization with enormous potential: new market structures. It is strategically advisable for us to develop our own platform-based systems or to participate in such systems. Platform-based business models that operate, for the most part, without infrastructure of their own bundle access to customers and structure the content of the offers. There are a number of well-known e: UBER, for instance, is currently revolutionizing the ta industry around the world, and AirBnB is tapping the demand of the market for hotel stays. The point here is less to efficiently structure and control resources than to promote and direct outside interaction. For the Lufthansa Group and many of its subsidiaries, this will involve a profound transformation.;In our group, we are developing initiatives in every dimension of digitalization at the airlines and at the service companies. Digital innovation will ensure that we have a competitive advantage, in particular wherever we can combine new technologies with e knowledge and many years of practical e.

Sales people that continue to use relationship selling will find that they get poorer results in return for a lot of hard work. Often, their prospect will be delighted at all the help, friendship and free consultancy that they get from these sales people. But they will often go elsewhere to place orders. So relationship sellers will struggle to control a solid sales pipeline. They may find it very hard to achieve the targets that they have been set.

See how the Xerox Color 8250 Production Printer helped to create new workflows and open new opportunities. Typically the right of first refusal for an inplant printer means that all the work goes to the inplant and they decide which work they will do, based on how busy they are and how their charges compare and decide if they going to do the work themselves or outsource the work.

In May, we announced that we started working with Diplomat Specialty Pharmacy, an industry leader in patient care, to give our customers and Shop Your Way members access to , bringing specialized support for a variety of diseases and conditions, including: HIV, Crohn disease, rheumatoid arthritis and Hepatitis C, among others. By 2018, specialty medications are projected to account for more than 51 percent of sales within the top 100 prescription products.

We now also offer , for any online prescription orders made through the . We just launched the service where members are able to post a question and get a response within 24 hours from a licensed Kmart pharmacist in their state. This service goes beyond what many key competitors are doing with general Q&A without member-specific support. Several months ago we took steps to narrow our focuses and begin a journey to implement back-to-basics best practices to be better positioned for profitable growth. To that end, was created, a program with specific goals and lead measures, which keeps reminding us to focus on the most important component to retail pharmacy success, our patients. We started with engaging physicians within our communities, making personal visits to their offices to discuss and introduce our services. We are making personal calls to our members to make sure they don forget to pick up their prescriptions and making sure all our chronic medication patients are enrolled in our auto-fill program so their prescriptions are ready on time. As part of the program, we are focused on Medication Therapy Management, which is another way for us to optimize drug therapy and improve therapeutic outcomes for our patients. We also heavily invest in acquiring new patients with in-store conversion opportunities as well as through more integrated and targeted initiatives to offer our products and services. Going back to the basics means that we are going the e mile of asking every member if they are up-to-date on all immunizations. This year we are aiming to meet the needs of all of our patients by offering multiple , including Zostavax, Pneumovax, Tdap/Td, Hepatitis A & B, HPV and MMR. In addition, we are looking to add travel vaccinations to our Kmart stores in geographic areas that need this service. We set a goal to be first-to-market this past flu season and with great team work . Kmart Pharmacy is your one stop shop for all immunizations this year. As we continue to cascade our e for Rx for Success to all stores and all associates, the groundswell of support builds, and that what we want: an organization working together to achieve profitable growth.

I on the right and Cameron on the left. I spend my time designing variable data templates, alongside another intern, Cameron Czadzeck. I was asked to give some advice to ne year interns, and there is so much to talk about. Here are my top five points of advice. Come into your position with little to no e about what you be doing. When I took this job, I thought I would work on printed materials, but I found myself doing more web and information design. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this. The e has e my skills to other areas, and allowed me to consider what I really want to do once I graduate. Don preemptively assume you know everything you do. Come in with a list of things you to do and place it alongside your daily do list. Not everything can be achieved, so you have no reason to overwork yourself and rush into disappointment when things don go perfectly the first time and they won perfectly well the first time, but hey, you fle. an intern, not a mind reader. RIT student shares 5 lessons. A few of my to do lists from across the summer. In a large company like Xerox, it sometimes takes momentum to launch a project. The more people you meet, the more meaningful relationships you cultivate. I joined the , an affinity group for the ne generation of leaders at Xerox. This group matched me (and other interns) with Xerox employees who have one to 10 years of e, and who work outside our departments. My mentor, Kate, knows e who to send me to within Xerox when I have questions about my career or goals that she can answer. She has been e supportive with my don know what I want yet, but I think I have a path and I see where it goes mentality. (That part of my e mantra.), Always keep in touch. This goes for the person who works three cubicles away from you as much as the CTO. It all good and well to have formal meetings and Q and A sessions, but really getting to know someone on a personal level can make all the difference in how you remembered. As a result of these conversations, I been asked to make designs for a tradeshow, write this article, and have one-on-one printing sessions where I set up my files for print. My manager calls these to my time because they enrich my summer e. I never would have had these opportunities if I hadn stuck my neck out and said , this is really cool. Can I learn more? Can I help with this? Me and Cameron at the intern program annual Redwings Game for interns and managers. You an intern, not a mind reader if you don know what your goal on a project should be, talk with your manager or a coworker about your concerns. You e to come in every day with questions, daily goals, and possibly an elevator speech about it all. Be certain that your goals, whenever you figure them out, are authentically yours. You should have passion or curiosity driving everything you want to achieve. People who work at Xerox will respect your honesty, whether or not you know e what e you are seeking. If you are honest, open, and authentic about these things, then you go further in your time here. Get out of your comfort zone. That how I got a great e and a good challenge from my internship at Xerox.

Its a game-changer, a step ahead, a paradigm shifter call it what you will. The point is, its another e of technology making giant leaps forward, and forcing businesses to think about how they respond.;In this case, its likely that millions of businesses will be thinking seriously about making a change to their wireless networks. Because any wireless network thats more than three years old is probably not up to the job of meeting todays demand for connectivity.;Just think back five years. We had the launch of the first iPad while still awestruck by the iPhone 3GS, neither of which are much use today as serious business tools. And the latest Wi-Fi network standard was 802.11n, with connection speeds of up to 600 megabits per second.;By 2011, IDC Research was telling us that more devices were being shipped without an Ethernet port than with one. And Deloitte reported that 425 million tablets and smartphones were sold, as opposed to 390 million desktops, laptops and netbooks.;Today, ABI Research estimates that there are close to 8 billion Wi-Fi-enabled devices competing for connection to the worlds wireless networks. The 802.11ac standard, introduced in 2013, delivers up to 1.2 gigabits per second twice the speed available just two years earlier.;Its certainly commonplace now for office workers to bring a smartphone, a tablet and a laptop to work and maybe even a Wi-Fi-hungry watch.;And, unlike in years past, those workers are not only surfing the web and using email, they are regularly video conferencing and working with other types of data-demanding applications. Mobility and security have become critical issues, especially for organisations that allow people to connect their own devices to their Wi-Fi network.;So if you and your team are getting frustrated with slow-responding business applications, or failed phone or video calls, its likely that the devices and applications youre using are asking more from your network than it can handle. Its time to upgrade, or go for a complete replacement.;But, as always with technology, new doesnt always mean best. And very often, if youre worried about picking the right wireless solution for the future, its worth partnering with a provider that understands the past, and why the technology is evolving in the way that it is.;Wireless in particular has a venerable heritage. Wi-Fi essentially uses the same principles Edison and Marconi were tinkering with in the earliest days of radio.;A deep understanding of the principles of radio is needed to ensure that the signal is delivered efficiently and at peak performance, wherever people need it.;The Wi-Fi standard itself IEEE 802.11 was actually established in 1999. Through acquisition, Zebra Technologies was part of the alliance that helped to author the standard.; is still relevant and valuable to many of the customers were working with. Its needed because the sheer speed and power of an 802.11ac wireless connection is rarely enough to provide the infrastructure todays businesses need.;Similarly, the fle and ease of management thats needed to accommodate constantly changing patterns of demand and to maintain security has to be designed into the core of the technology.;The good news is that the latest wireless technologies are future-ready.

On January 10th, at the Digital Aviation Forum in Frankfurt, we presented the digital portfolio of our group to decision makers, the media, and our customers.;Digitalization can result in major increases in efficiency. Chatbots digital advisors based on artificial intelligence noticeably lighten the load of our service centres. Our customers benefit from shorter hold times.

With over 100 million passengers per year, how can we use the increasing number of customer interactions and the resulting data streams to make even better decisions? The keyword here is big data. We can use customer analytics and artificial intelligence to deduce customer preferences and to personalize and optimize our guests travel e.;There is another level of digitalization with enormous potential: new market structures. It is strategically advisable for us to develop our own platform-based systems or to participate in such systems. Platform-based business models that operate, for the most part, without infrastructure of their own bundle access to customers and structure the content of the offers. There are a number of well-known e: UBER, for instance, is currently revolutionizing the ta industry around the world, and AirBnB is tapping the demand of the market for hotel stays. The point here is less to efficiently structure and control resources than to promote and direct outside interaction.

The emergence of smart, connected products through the;is shifting the OEM business model from one based on selling individual products to one that sells systems of connected products, sensors, data, and services.;To learn how the IoT is impacting the manufacturing industry, I spoke with Jim Hilton, Director of Global Solutions Marketing at Zebra Technologies.;is a global solutions and services company focused on making businesses as smart and connected as the world we live in and making the IoT the transformative technological initiative of the decade. Hilton is in charge of manufacturing, transportation, and logistics solutions, which, for Zebra, is all about tracking the visibility of goods, assets, people, processes, and places.;Zebras products provide visibility from inception so end users and service organizations can see how efficiently an asset is functioning and set parameters to alert them when its performing below a specified level.;It used to be that maintenance for an asset was reactive, said Hilton. The machine malfunctioned on a production line, therefore the red light went off because someone pressed a button and the engineer came running with a screwdriver. Preventive maintenance used to be a technician walked up with an index card and checked off the vitals of that asset.;That process has evolved and revolutionized to the point that now you have an enterprise grade ability to do predictive maintenance. In other words, the sensor in the asset essentially tells the maintenance department: you should take a look at this because the vitals are not looking the way theyre supposed to. And, by the way, if you ignore it, in about 3 weeks, the machine is going to stop working completely.;This sort of insight into equipment health and performance is what;.

The best part every decision is backed by concrete data so manufacturers arent wasting time focusing on areas that dont work or trying to sell service contracts customers dont need.; Hilton says that manufacturers have been capturing data since the 80s but it was so difficult to get that many businesses didnt do anything with it. The emergence of the cloud and the IoT type products built into machines today make collecting and analyzing data easier and less e.; Because of the cloud and smart, connected products, data can be handed up without the ball and chain of a network. IoT has taken what was just simple automation and made it actionable. Through the cloud, with systems to store and display data, anyone around the world can see that data while theres still time to do something with it.; You need both: the ability to capture and interpret data. For e, Hilton said, if theres a two week delay for service businesses to see insights from data, what good is that? There needs to be instant access, which is where a;is key.

For a preview, watch at this year HIMSS UK event. With Lord Carter also calling for all NHS trusts to have key digital systems in place integrated and utilized by October 2018, it clear that the drive to digitize is on. Xerox is partnering with the NHS in many different areas to make digital transformation happen. We helping trusts improve patient safety by digitizing paper medical records, reducing office print volumes and improving document security, as well as printing patient leaflets and forms more efficiently and economically.

There are dots everywhere between Tehran and Frankfurt. If they are white, then the air is calm. Green dots indicate minor vertical air movements, while yellow or orange dots mean turbulence.;Sometimes turbulence literally comes out of a clear blue sky. First, there is slight juddering and then a sudden loss of height and the Fasten seat belt signs light up. We still dont have comprehensive forecasts that are accurate and reliable enough, says 43-year-old Karssemeijer. Currently pilots are given a weather forecast during their briefing, showing flight legs of several hundred kilometers in length where it might or might not be bumpy. Thats not a great help to us, says A380 Copilot Oliver Matz.;But Lufthansa pilots may soon have more accurate information about the location and strength of turbulence. Model forecasts will show turbulence on the navigation map in the cockpit. The eddy dissipation rate (EDR) measurement method is used on the electronic flight bag (EFB) in the cockpit to check the forecast. This produces a trail of white, green, yellow and orange dots. The EDR identifies how the energy in the atmosphere is distributed, regardless of the size, weight and speed of the aircraft. When an aircraft passes through turbulence, the system automatically records the strength of the shock on a scale from zero (calm) to one (e turbulence).;In the future, aircraft will be able to send the figure and the coordinates via a server on the ground to other planes in real time. Pilots will be able to move to a different altitude or at least warn flight attendants and passengers in good time, according to Karssemeijer. This will also allow dispatchers to make their flight schedules more accurate.;Karssemeijer, who is not only a pilot but also a project manager at Lufthansa, was responsible for implementing the EDR measurement method on the EFB. We make use of a variety of avionics data and the different concepts of in-flight connectivity, e Matz. Together with Karssemeijer, Matz carried out successful tests of the new system on two flights to Frankfurt.;The results are currently being used to assess the quality of the model forecasts. This will lay the foundations for a system that predicts turbulence for the airlines in the Lufthansa Group.

Business & Workplace Author, Speaker and Consultant Yesterday I traveled to the Gil Hatch Center for Customer Innovation in Rochester, N.Y., to talk with my partner and visiting press and analysts about the future of work and office technology. Given that the office isn a physical location anymore, both software and hardware must be configured to be used effectively and efficiently by a growing virtual, mobile and contract workforce. Whether you are an enterprise or an SMB, here are the must-haves for your technology. Technology must be accessible anytime, anywhere, by both full-time and contract workers. Mobile phones must be able to seamlessly communicate with other devices via the Internet of Things as well as any onsite infrastructures and systems, and users want to automate complex processes with a single touch or action. And, all of this must be done with minimal intervention from IT as these professionals can only assist so many people at once. In 2016, fle is king, meaning that the days of the majority of your employees working together in the same location are likely numbered. But technology must facilitate virtual work in which it just as easy and productive to engage with your colleague in Japan as it is with the one in the cubicle ne door. Technology must be agile, with the ability to support new collaboration apps being developed on the consumer side or via in-house citizen development. 5 must-haves for your technology, whether you are enterprise or SMB. via @alevit http:/ctt.ec/f6OpJ+ #IT #OfficeTech When it comes to intellectual property residing in the cloud, security remains the biggest concern. Organizations want their data stored in a central location and accessible by everyone who needs it, but documents must be managed in a way that is controllable and protects them from internal and e threats and breeches. Employees have variable needs and every individual has his or her own way of doing things, so mandating a certain process for using technology is a surefire way to hinder adoption. Tomorrow office systems must be personalized so that whether you prefer to print via mobile or manual methods or scan via email or QR codes, you covered. Despite the obviously increasing sophistication of office technology demands, according to IDC, 40 percent of smartphone users and 35 percent of tablet users don even know how to print from their device. So, as an e of new office technologies that address these demands while also simplifying solutions for the individual, Xerox has just released the 14 . In order to accommodate a diverse mobile workforce, the MFPs are designed with an intuitive user display with ready-to-use MFP applications right on the interface. In particular, the Mobile Link app lets users create one-touch, automated workflows on their mobile devices to remotely control a Xerox MFP and transmit documents to fax, email and cloud-hosted services like Box, Dropbox and Google Drive. And, perhaps most importantly, the new MFPs have secure print and scan encryption so companies can ensure that documents remain confidential.

Organized feedback is very common and includes customer surveys, social reviews and marketing research. This data-driven approach allows to make strategic decisions about their shows and other industry initiatives. The key here is the balance between emotion and numbers.

This conversation is about the practical ways in which retailers can use data and analytics to build a relationship with todays consumer.;Firstly, lets identify the challenge. We as shoppers are now e fickle, driven of course by price but equally by convenience and service. The customer is empowered by more information, advice and options.;And the solution? The usual approach is a loyalty scheme rewarding customers for spending and for returning. The best of these programmes deliver personalised rewards, but many still focus on impersonal loyalty points awarded based on amount spent.;Even though technology and data have made it easier to create a loyalty programme, it seems harder than ever to generate loyalty. The key point is that loyalty is driven by much more than offers and discounts. Its about delivering the perfect e for the customer and what customers want is convenience. So retailers need to make the shoppers e appropriate, and that often means simple and quick.;Advanced, invisible analytics whether predictive, real time or historical, have the power to help retailers deliver a more connected, personalised e that meets the needs of the modern shopper. And 2015 is set to be the year where the use of data and analytics in retail becomes more prolific. But for retailers to grasp the opportunity it often requires internal process changes and of course the inevitable technology investment.;Done correctly, that investment has serious potential for return.;But where is the right place to start? Well, as with all the best elements of retail, it has to start with the customer:;Guest Wi-Fi is the starting point, helping connect customers to key store data, allowing them to find the information they need to make an informed decision:;Understandably, many retailers hesitate to make it easier for customers to compare prices, the ; even allows shoppers to take a photo of an item in store and see similar products available via Amazon. But, retailers cant fight this trend. If customers cant access the information they need to feel comfortable with a purchase theyll often walk away.;For this reason, we are seeing an upsurge in retailers adopting in-store customer shopping apps incorporating information, store maps and offers. Built on the Wi-Fi network and Bluetooth technology, indoor location technology and mobile store maps help shoppers to find items quickly.;But theres another benefit for retailers, and that is the ability to collect data and map individual in-store journeys. This allows retailers to see something new what the customer looked at, but didnt buy. True customer level insight into every journey where customers opt-in.;Through this retailers can start to develop bespoke promotions to individuals based on who they are, what they are interested in, their location in store and more importantly, at the point of decision. It also gives retailers a view of behavioural trends and the chance to respond through the flow of the store.;These location-based technologies help shoppers find the right product and give retailers the insight to continually improve the customer e.;And making the customers journey easier, is the key to creating the e interactions and customer engagement required to build a relationship.; Topics: ;, ;, ;, ;, ;, ;, ;, ; '",zebra,2,13,120.582,0.2,-0.25,n,y,n,n,n,-0.0041952099,0.0193798664,-0.0286813572,-0.0788440507,-0.0260886906,3376,224,6.63507109,41.63,n,n,y,y,y,4,3,5,1,2

There are dots everywhere between Tehran and Frankfurt. If they are white, then the air is calm. Green dots indicate minor vertical air movements, while yellow or orange dots mean turbulence.;Sometimes turbulence literally comes out of a clear blue sky. First, there is slight juddering and then a sudden loss of height and the Fasten seat belt signs light up. We still dont have comprehensive forecasts that are accurate and reliable enough, says 43-year-old Karssemeijer. Currently pilots are given a weather forecast during their briefing, showing flight legs of several hundred kilometers in length where it might or might not be bumpy. Thats not a great help to us, says A380 Copilot Oliver Matz.;But Lufthansa pilots may soon have more accurate information about the location and strength of turbulence. Model forecasts will show turbulence on the navigation map in the cockpit. The eddy dissipation rate (EDR) measurement method is used on the electronic flight bag (EFB) in the cockpit to check the forecast. This produces a trail of white, green, yellow and orange dots. The EDR identifies how the energy in the atmosphere is distributed, regardless of the size, weight and speed of the aircraft. When an aircraft passes through turbulence, the system automatically records the strength of the shock on a scale from zero (calm) to one (e turbulence).;In the future, aircraft will be able to send the figure and the coordinates via a server on the ground to other planes in real time. Pilots will be able to move to a different altitude or at least warn flight attendants and passengers in good time, according to Karssemeijer. This will also allow dispatchers to make their flight schedules more accurate.;Karssemeijer, who is not only a pilot but also a project manager at Lufthansa, was responsible for implementing the EDR measurement method on the EFB. We make use of a variety of avionics data and the different concepts of in-flight connectivity, e Matz. Together with Karssemeijer, Matz carried out successful tests of the new system on two flights to Frankfurt.;The results are currently being used to assess the quality of the model forecasts. This will lay the foundations for a system that predicts turbulence for the airlines in the Lufthansa Group.

Well, Amazon Dash is a small Wi-Fi connected electronic button device that allows you to re-order your favourite products in an instant. Each Dash Button is paired with a single product and enables quick and easy purchase at the point-of-use in the home.; ;Amazon Dash really is the ultimate convenience. Should these wonder buttons catch on, they really could revolutionise the way we pick up many of our favourite brands. By streamlining the act of purchasing, brands and consumers alike can enjoy the benefits of a frictionless shopping e. What do I mean by frictionless? In essence, Im talking hassle-free shopping. A frictionless shopping e is simple, works without difficulty, and prioritises ease of use above all else.;This concept of hassle-free shopping certainly appeals to me! I know there have been many instances where Ive been unable to pick up my favourite brands, despite going out of my way to collect them. That moment you reach the aisle, look up and find an ominous gap where your favourite coffee should be is particularly disheartening. The opportunity to avoid such incessant disappointment is most welcome!;As we move into the future, theres no doubt retailers will look to offer a frictionless shopping e of their own, and further simplify the way we buy in-store. After all, they have to do something to compete with the digital alternatives available at our fingertips 24/7. In fact, Tesco has already started on their journey to offering a frictionless shopping e with their If This Then That campaign. Allowing customers to connect platforms and create action based triggers, Tesco are providing the tools necessary to enable a fully customisable frictionless shopping e. Customers with the right know-how can now set up their own algorithms to ensure products are automatically ordered when certain circumstances are met. While this is perhaps a little complicated for the average shopper right now, its a sign of positive intent from the UKs largest grocery retailer.;Its really no surprise retailers are looking to achieve a frictionless shopping e. With common inconveniences removed, the act of buying will be simplified even further and this intern should drive repeat custom. By taking out unnecessary processes, and automating those that cannot be removed, the retail e is set to deliver greater efficiency and value than ever before. Through the adoption of a smart infrastructure that actively monitors and manages resources, retailers will achieve a whole new level of performance. For e, new checkouts will be opened automatically based on the length of queues waiting and stock will be instantly replenished as and when it runs out on the shop floor. The ability to reactively adapt to these situations really will fundamentally change the retail e, from top to bottom.;Theres no doubt about it, technology throughout retail has developed at an incredible pace and has yielded some truly remarkable breakthroughs. Whether were shopping in-store or online, the act of buying has never been so easy.

Everything went well until the customer asked me how things were going. ! I replied. maybe I should have put my glasses on before I did that last adjustment on your copier. I then pulled holographic glasses with huge, 3D eyes out of my pocket, and put them on. The woman screamed at the top of her lungs and the entire office went silent, as they turned to see me red-faced and bug-eyed. If not for several women who found this hysterical, my Xerox career would have been brief. Whether you are moving into a new assignment, relocating for convenience, or simply taking on a new customer, a good first impression will start any new relationship off on the right foot. I spent 30 years servicing Xerox equipment in the field , had several reassignments, a relocation, and come in contact with countless new customers. First impressions are vitally important to me, and I learned that how you present yourself should not be taken lightly. Here are the top five things I learned about how to begin a lasting business relationship. For e customers, someone has already found out what not to say. Ask colleagues for any scoop they have on a customer likes and dislikes. For new customers, an Internet search will help you become familiar with the business environment you are walking into. we get so caught up in letting customers know what we have to offer that we miss out completely on what they want. Donald B. Stephens, senior customer service engineer for Xerox. When accepting a relocation to another country, this is a must. But don take it for granted if you are simply moving to another area of the same country. You will shoot yourself in the foot if you take the not going to act like these country bumpkins approach. Watch the people you work with and learn. You save yourself a lot of embarrassment and make better impressions. yourself is the advice you hear most when meeting new people, but for certain personality types, that can get you into trouble quickly. Certainly, you don want to be phony, but pouring on the can be overwhelming. I like to joke around with customers, and it has made for great relations, but first I have to earn the right. I made some of my biggest blunders by making wise-cracks before I understood the customer sense of humor. Your cell rings it the boss. You being sent to a customer who has hit the ceiling and is threatening to cancel. At the same time your spouse te you to say a water pipe has e over the baby crib. A bit e? Maybe, but you get the point. We all make promises that we intend to keep, but our busy, stressful lives often sidetrack us and keep us from following through. Customers understand this and are forgiving, but just like jesting, you have to earn the right to be forgiven. It human nature to doubt the sincerity of a stranger. Don cement that doubt by breaking early promises, even for simple matters. Sometimes we get so caught up in letting customers know what we have to offer that we miss out completely on what they want. A good listener asks open-ended questions that seek to gain understanding on how to serve a customer better, which is what will keep you in business and make a positive impression that will be hard to forget. and receive email updates when we publish a new article.

For people who blog or consult on the side, in addition to their regular jobs, handling messages from multiple work lives is all the more challenging. have used tools that automatically prioritize messages, but they not proactive, nor do they offer a high enough level of personalization to be truly effective, Dazo said. Technology enables us to receive more messages, quicker than before. Is that helpful? And yet, isn it a bit scary to allow a machine do things without being told? Are we comfortable to let go of these tasks and trust the technology? Dazo points to the debate over driverless cars. He admits the threshold will be different for each person. Some will embrace automation whole heartedly, others not so much. Insofar as you may not be ready to trust a driverless car, you probably comfortable with cruise control and anti-lock brakes. So the trip to automation may be gradual for some of us. technology changes how we think and what we think about, Dazo said. have to figure out what technology do for us, and what must do for ourselves. As we reshape our thinking about technology, our work environments shift as well. Artificial intelligence will eventually catch up to our needs. This is the reality that informs the Xerox view of the nature of page: Hard copy and digital information from multiple sources, in multiple forms, accessible on multiple platforms. How efficiently can it be collected, understood, modified and shared? We have many choices maybe too many. But that the reality. How do we keep technology moving forward so that it solves more problems than it creates? Solve for that, and you the page is set free. Eventually, a software program will be able to determine that rare message from Aunt Sue is urgent and give it precedence over your manager inquiries maybe even quicker than your grandfather secretary did back in the day. will always give us value, and allow us to make better decisions, Dazo said.

But sometimes it even more fun to -discover an old favorite. isn just a classic local product. It a local and national treasure, too. Fran Bigelow opened her original Seattle store, Fran Patisserie & Chocolate Specialties, in 1982, focusing on freshly baked pastries and cakes. Her move toward confections began gradually; if you were lucky enough to be one of the early customers, you were often treated to a free chocolate truffle while waiting in line to purchase baked goods. Yum! Today, Fran Chocolates are known and loved far beyond the Pacific Northwest. She been featured on the Food Network and in newspapers around the country. When President Barack Obama was on the campaign trail four years ago, he discovered her legendary Smoked Salt Caramels and went bonkers for them. Now, special visitors to the White House receive a box of the salted caramels stamped with the Presidential Seal as a parting gift half in milk chocolate (The President favorite) and half in dark chocolate (First Lady Michelle preference). And of course, you can find Fran Chocolates in Whole Foods Market stores throughout the US. Since Fran marks 30 years of producing one-of-a-kind sweets on June 1 of this year, I took a tour of their production kitchens with CEO Andrina Bigelow, Fran daughter, to learn just what makes them so special. Hue (shown here) has been part of Fran for 19 years, and in the early years it was just Fran and Hue tying the ribbons on each box. Today Hue is the supervisor of packing and is still giving each box of chocolates that special touch. The quality of the product on the inside is matched by the presentation. I found the secret to Fran success can be boiled down to the highest quality ingredients; unwavering attention to detail with a focus on taste; and hiring and nurturing a talented team. I could see these principles demonstrated everywhere I looked on my tour, and it no surprise to me that they been going strong for as long as they have. Here to 30 more years!

When the Hack Reactor group was created something magical happened. I had 100% of Hack Reactor employees participating in an activity involving health and getting SUPER e/competitive about it. People started walking to work and almost everyone admitted to walking in circles around their house late at night to get to their 10,000 step goal each day,says Maggie.;Recently I told employees they would earn one fresh organic juice for the office for every 25,000 steps walked and the person with the most steps per week was given power to choose the juice types. Some of us are really competitive, and some of us love juice, and were now walking on average 4,300 more steps per week. Combining collaborative and competitive elements helped motivate employees to walk more and encourage each other,says Maggie.;We are also sleeping better! A study from Brigham and Womens Hospital shows that the more sleep deprived a person, the worse his or her work becomes. Our Fitbit trackers measure how long and how well we sleep, so we can look into our sleep patterns and collect information about what might be less than optimal conditions for a good nights rest,says Maggie.;Our health initiative isnt just confined to staff. We recently started the Elevator Haters Club where students and staff compete to see how many times they can walk up the 8 flights of stairs to our floor instead of using the elevator,says Maggie.;Recently our staff has been happier and more productive.

Research from says that US companies lose an estimated $41 billion every year after a bad customer e. Additionally, almost half of US consumers will take their business elsewhere after e less than adequate customer service. Regardless of industry, consumers e their interactions with brands to be painless, and if they not, they won hesitate to move on. This is especially the case with the millennial generation who generally have a much higher e for immediate results. E customer service is a must, so what is holding companies back? One major challenge is the inherent differences that e between the physical and digital touch points that impact customer e and the way companies have attempted to implement corporate change. We, the customers, are living in a digital age and are demanding companies do the same. As technology evolves, many companies risk being left behind by relying on outdated, paper-intensive processes. A study revealed that more than half of respondents admitted their organization processes are largely, or entirely, still paper-based. Paper-based processes are manual and time-intensive, leaving less time to engage and grow e customers. As companies begin to optimize and improve their customer service, the best place to start is by digitizing and streamlining all forms of customer communications. Regardless of the channel direct mail, email or social media information needs to be consistent, relevant, and timely, and span a variety of channels to meet customer preferences to deliver an effective, memorable customer e. Many vendors can help with these efforts, but Xerox holistic vision of the entire customer lifecycle journey acquire, onboard, serve and grow is unique and allows companies to engage with their prospective and current customers along every step of the way, whether it is to address effective ways to help them retain clients or acquire new ones.

Almost two thirds (60.1%) of shoppers are willing to buy more merchandise from a retailer that they believe provides better customer service. So its vital that retailers get it right, especially when you consider that consumers are using smart phones to gain information on products and pricing before, during and after the in-store visit.;Zebras recent European Shopper Survey revealed that customers want a mobile in-store e. 42.1% of respondents said they have a better e when staff use the latest technology to assist them. In particular, customers felt their e is improved when mobile computers are used by staff to check stock availability (55.6%) and to take payments anywhere in store (46.5%) a view I share.;Given the significance of getting the in-store e right, retailers should be looking at how they can deploy this technology. Especially since, as the way we shop continues to evolve, the use of mobile devices will eventually be considered the norm and instead retailers will be e to invest in beacon technology, automated sales processes and personalised displays.;Mobile technology has led to a huge shift in the way we shop. As online retailers are typically perceived to offer products at a lower price compared to their brick and mortar counterparts, the practice of showrooming is becoming increasingly popular and mobile devices only make the process easier. Retailers therefore need to look at ways in which they can embrace this new method of shopping.;I am pleased to see that retailers are beginning to capitalise on the phenomenon of reverse showrooming; by perfecting the integration between offline and digital channels, retailers are beating e-commerce competitors on convenience. Knowledgeable sales staff, in-store pick-up and smartphone discounts are all being used to bring and keep showroomers in-store. However, I would like to see more retailers offering customers real-time marketing offers while they are in-store looking at products to give customers a reason not to purchase online.;We as customers are inundated with communications from brands and with their being little incentive for us to remain loyal, retailers need to find new ways to use loyalty schemes to build strong customer relationships. App-based loyalty schemes enable real-time, location based offers so that brands can stop bombarding their customers and instead provide us with offers and incentives when we actually want them. The same app can also deliver a whole array of other services to customers such as product location, origin and even in some cases such as Starbucks act as stored value for easy payment.;Loyalty programmes offer retailers an e opportunity to gain in-depth customer insights that can be used to personalise the e, build better customer relationships and discourage showrooming. However, our survey revealed that only 38.9% of shoppers have downloaded a shopping-related app and just 9.7% use a smartphone loyalty scheme. Retailers need to target this large potential customer group to download their apps to ensure they can capitalise on loyalty schemes moving forwards.;All in all, mobile technology is already playing a key role in the development of retail and will only become more integral both to the sector and the way we as consumers wish to shop in the future. As sales processes are automated mobile devices will become essential, the threat of showrooming will have to be reversed through the use of mobile technology and customer loyalty will need to be far more timely and location based as it too becomes mobile.;To read the ; and learn more about why mobile technology was one of the key trends of 2015, click the button below:; Topics: ;, ;, ; '",zebra,3,14,125.858,0.2,-0.05,n,y,n,n,n,-0.0353999202,0.0030829052,-0.0494585054,-0.0850660107,-0.0201211572,3800,258,6.7894736842,27.53,n,n,y,y,y,4,3,5,1,2

The goal is to improve customer satisfaction and address the life style needs of todays connected consumer.;Before I discuss iOS 8, I will cover how Wi-Fi is used in these engagement applications and the importance of the MAC address on the mobile device.;Businesses use Wi-Fi to identify and communicate with a customer through their mobile device while they are in and around the business location. If Wi-Fi is enabled, a mobile device will search for a Wi-Fi access point to connect to. During this process, the mobile device transmits its unique MAC address via a Probe Request. If the customer has the brand app on their device and is registered to automatically connect to the business Wi-Fi, their device will automatically connect. An analytics platform like MPact will identify the customer, enabling the business to deliver a welcome message or a customized offer.;If the registered customer has chosen not to automatically connect to the Wi-Fi, but Wi-Fi is enabled, the analytics platform can still associate the device MAC address to the customer. In this scenario, a message may be sent through the app via LTE unless the customer has opted out of push notifications.;In the case of unregistered mobile customers with no app installed, customers that have their Wi-Fi enabled will broadcast their MAC addresses via the Probe Requests. Though the analytics platform will not know who they are, the business will be able to determine if the user is outside or inside a location, record and monitor their MAC address for frequent visits, determine at which locations they shop, as well as the number of mobile customers at each location. These analytics help the business determine the potential to connect with new connected consumers and design new incentives to attract more mobile users to download their app and become a member.;In each of these scenarios, the MAC address provides an important element of associating a device to a user. With this in mind, the latest release of Apples iOS 8 noted that it would be using a random MAC address, creating a pseudo address under certain conditions on Apple mobile devices. The use of random MAC addresses could potentially affect analytics, especially if one device could broadcast many different MAC addresses, virtually looking like many different devices. We tested a number of Apple devices with iOS 8 to characterize how they behave and the impact, if any, this has on analytics and location;As a result of our testing, we discovered that only the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5S with iOS 8 have this feature and we determined that there is minimal impact on MPact analytics and locationing. The iPhones only transmitted the random MAC when the phone entered sleep mode and the location based services and cellular data services are turned off. However, if a phone does transmit random MAC addresses, these can be filtered out in analytics since these pseudo MAC addresses do not have a valid vendor prefix.;When it comes to location tracking, the users device must be connected to the Wi-Fi and once the device is associated and connected to the Wi-Fi, it will always provide its unique MAC address.; Topics: ;, ;, ;, ;, ;, ; '",zebra,2,11,124.983,0.2,-0.25,n,y,n,n,n,-0.0100553291,0.0378295119,-0.0270400041,-0.0713066868,-0.0242325653,3771,272,7.2129408645,29.96,n,n,y,y,y,4,3,5,1,2

It is often the attribute that separates success from failure.

The trends are fast-changing in customer care, with 2015 shaping up to be another transformative year. E at WDS have put together their in the ne 12 months. The headline notwithstanding, I present three trends from our report to whet your appetite. Each is accompanied by 90-second videos of Xerox researchers who share related insights from their work. I think you appreciate the insights, and I look forward to continuing this conversation at your leisure. By the end of 2015, Forrester Research reports, 42 percent of the world population will own a smartphone. The ubiquitous device increasingly defines how we communicate, how we travel, how we shop and how we engage with brands. If a customer wants to communicate with a brand, it increasingly likely to be through a mobile device. E: According to the Wall Street Journal, Hilton Worldwide is investing $550 million to optimize their mobile customer e, from start to finish. During 2014, we also saw Starbucks and Citibank start using mobile e to promote customer loyalty. The challenge for companies will be how to integrate mobile, and all it represents, into a larger ecosystem of contact methodologies. Organizations will be e to the conte of a conversation that may have spread out across various channels over days, weeks or even months. When engaging a brand for support, today customers have an abundance of choices. But not all channels are created equally. You have a 90 percent chance of a successful resolution when contacting a call center; over social channels or Web services, the probability drops to 70 percent. The reason is quite simple: Customers often can find the answer to their problems and also miss out on the benefits of the two-way nature of a conversation. Machine learning and natural language processing is reinventing our view of self-service and driving new levels of success. A new generation of virtual agents will emerge this year that can learn from terabytes of data to provide conte, relevant responses instantly and with the same accuracy as a live agent in a call center. Great customer care is defined by the ability to provide an e that is e right for each unique customer. But this can be a tall order, particularly for medium-to-large companies. There are just too many people to meet. But brands can now lean on smart machines to get better acquainted with their customers, without the limitations of scale. Capable of collecting huge volumes of data and processing this to surface valuable and timely customer insights, at an individual level, brands will be better able to add that personal touch. Harnessing both big and small data processing, tomorrow smart customer care technology will listen to big data to spot trends and prioritize appropriate action. and receive email updates when we publish a new article.

We caught up with Christophe after the event. It an increasingly big issue for our customers. Technology has made so many things so much faster, it really highlights the inefficiencies of processes that are still very manual. Inefficiency is costly, so there a real drive to streamline and accelerate these processes by automating manual steps as far as possible and eliminating the need to move physical paper around. We been working on different aspects of for years; what we showed at IT is how it all comes together. We integrated a variety of information management technologies, including , information categorisation technologies, and workflow and platforms. Together these let us digitise information, make it accessible from anywhere, rapidly and reliably identify specific information, and automatically route it where it needs to go. We are; we combining certain techniques to categorise unstructured data more quickly and reliably than other methods. Then we put these capabilities in the hands of knowledge workers through . One of the use cases we demonstrated at IT is e-discovery. Legal teams often have very little time to comb through millions of electronic files to find the ones relevant to a case or audit. The nature of legal relevance makes it very difficult to narrow the field just with keyword searches. Many e-discovery tools include to help: this groups documents by how similar they are to one another, based purely on statistical analysis of the content, not any predefined criteria or search terms. It a powerful tool, but we taken it a step further to create a solution that we call CategoriX. This is a statistical categorisation technology that adds a machine learning capability. Using CategoriX, we take a sample of the total volume of files and have legal reviewers categorise them as relevant or not. The algorithms from this e categorisation and create an appropriate statistical model. With only a small amount of the algorithm can process the vast majority of the content e quickly and accurately. we helped a customer respond to a regulatory subpoena in 54 days, with 92.3% precision and 99.8% recall. We used just 10 of the company attorneys; they would have needed 68 additional attorneys to achieve the same results without the categorisation technology. It used by Xerox managed services such as for e-discovery, and Xerox Document Transaction Processing Services. So customers of those services benefit from these capabilities. Wherever you can reliably isolate relevant files through keyword searches or through their structure, you got a potential use case. For e, we use it to analyse whether contracts are complying with regulatory requirements, or for narrowing down thousands of job applicants. It still early days for this technology so we actively e potential use cases with customers. They can contact me at and I try to answer their questions or direct them to someone who can.

She realised there was nothing she could do. so she abandoned her home and took her husband and children to assist the Shell crisis team that had set up in another city.;And even now, with the sun coming back out and freeways beginning to emerge again from the water, the challenges keep on coming. and the professionalism in the face of those challenges keeps on coming.;The resilience that has been on show in Te has also been present 9,000 miles away in Mumbai, where floods have also hit and where Shell staff have also kept on going despite everything.;Shell planned for corporate resilience. but not the depths of human resilience we have witnessed: the courage, the grit and the determination.;I have never been more proud of the company that I work for than today. I have never been more impressed by those I work with than now, or felt more honoured to call them my colleagues.

In September 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration released its final ruling on legislation requiring all medical devices distributed in the United States to carry a Unique Device Identifier (UDI) label. The regulation covers all products classified as medical devices, including Class I, II, and III devices, InVitro devices, software, and some tissue-based products.;The UDI law will be implemented over the course of several years, beginning with Class III devices, which must be fully compliant by September 24, 2014. The FDA has provided a schedule that details the mandatory compliance deadlines for different types of products. Any company that is not compliant by the required date will be prohibited from selling or distributing covered products in the United States.;We posed the following questions to David Coons, vice president, Advanced Markets and Technology at Zebra.;A: Class III medical devices and human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based product (HCT/P) regulated as a device must be labeled with a UDI by September 24, 2014.;A: The UDI is comprised of a Device Identifier (DI) and a Production Identifier (PI). These two identifiers can be separate or integrated together, but they both must be present.;The DI is a fi numeric or alphanumeric string that uniquely identifies the labeler and the specific version or model of a device. The PI holds variable production control data such as lot number, serial number, manufacturing date, and/or e date of a device identified by the DI.;A: Maybe, but probably not. Compliance involves the printing of a properly formatted label with a Device ID andProduct ID in both human and machine readable formats. The UDI is NOT a code that is self-generated or inventedby your company. The code must be approved by the FDA and issued by one of three companies that havereceived special FDA accreditation.In addition, the Device ID must be registered in the FDAs Global Unique Device Identifier Database (GUDID)before it may be used on a UDI label. Unless your company has satisfied all the requirements, you are not UDIcompliant.;A: To date there are three independent entities that FDA has accredited to develop and issue UDIs to the medicaldevice industry.;A: Yes, every product in a covered product category must have its own DI. In fact each packing level (each carton,case, etc.) will need its own DI. Remember that the law even covers software that is classified as a medicaldevice. This means that companies may have hundreds or thousands of codes to obtain and manage.;A: The FDA GUDID database currently requires appro 60 data fields to be provided for every DI. Thesedata fields include device descriptions, company information, packaging information, storage and handlingconditions, sterilization information, etc. The FDA may modify or add to these required attributes periodically.;A: There are two possible ways to upload and manage your companys data in the GUDID.;Stay tuned for Part 2 of the Q&A on Thursday!;For more information, visit;or contact:;Mark Borah;Zebra Technologies;Business Development Manager;mborah@zebra.com;800-423-0442;To download the PDF version ofUDI Labeling Requirements for Medical Devices: Part 1, click the download button below.; Topics: ;, ;, ;, ;, ; '",zebra,5,23,105.705,0.2,-0.4,y,n,n,n,n,0.0093287981,-0.0112144309,-0.0265379238,-0.0721420779,-0.0228980019,3317,207,6.2405788363,30.64,n,n,y,y,y,4,3,5,1,2

A common statement when people reference their smartphone people of all ages. Some would insist they are no less important than our eyes, ears, hands or feet, or so it seems. Actually, in many cases smart devices enhance sensory perception, safety, awareness and certainly communications. The Smart Mobility Era is here, and the they are a. While smartphones, tablets and similar mobile devices remain prevalent, a new generation of technologies are coming that will rock the boat in terms of how we live our lives and do our jobs. (Some are here already.) recognize the power and potential of mobility, and are in a fever to showcase demonstrative results. Jim Joyce Think Google Glasses, Wi-Fi watches, even wireless and sensor circuitry woven within our shirts and pants. Today, think of the Fitbit, Samsung GALAXY Gear, Sony SmartBand and recent chatter about smart contact lenses. someone who personally suffers from hearing loss, I have an app I can use to adjust sounds around me taking out background noise and allowing me to focus more specifically on certain conversations or sounds. The common denominator among these devices is data. For every phone, tablet or pair of glasses, there a steady flow of information, coming and going, that can be collected, analyzed and applied in numerous ways. Most of this information focuses on unstructured data such as video, graphs, photographs and documents. The push to consumerize such devices is proliferating. But equally powerful is the use of mobile devices wearables the workplace. They may be the ne-generation tool that helps you do your job. Such technologies are a core component for companies set upon advancing workplace agility ability to respond and act quickly, be nimble, proactive and more responsive. agility requires companies to invent and innovate so their entire companies can operate as a mobile enterprise. Xerox is working with several organizations to enable mobile, cloud, big data and analytics to work together in this way. Organizations recognize the power and potential of mobility, and are in a fever to showcase demonstrative results. Consider how wearables and mobility can transform classrooms, hospitals, manufacturing plants and especially services companies. Imagine working in a chemical plant wearing an intrinsically safe wristwatch-like device that monitors air quality in real time and sends immediate alerts prior to a crisis. Worse, if a disaster occurs, that same device becomes a voice-enabled avatar that leads you to the closest evacuation e. It can all be mind-blowing in technology terms, but the real heart of workplace agility is its focus on people frontline workers in a company who walk the sales floor, repair the air conditioners, or give medicines to patients. They are the ones who will define which companies are most successful and most agile. They are likely to be the pioneers of the newest wearables and related devices. It a new time. A new era. A new window of opportunity to race ahead of industry laggards. Customers win because they gain the benefit of frontline workers who work smarter and faster, and are fully informed, engaged and connected. Ultimately, you are the winner with an agile workplace, equipped workers and customers who keep coming back. can help companies improve their workplace agility.

For the first time, passengers will have the option of making a selection from the on-board program from home before setting off and adding their favorite items to a playlist.;To do this, all passengers need to do is load the ""Lufthansa Companion App"" onto their own tablet or mobile phone. The on-board program is available up to six weeks in advance. Once on board, passengers then synchronize their personal favorite playlist with the screen in front of the seat, and there is also the option to use the own mobile device as a second screen. During the flight, passengers can then choose something to watch from their favorites list, and at the same time call up flight information, go on social media websites via FlyNet, do a little online shopping in the WorldShop, or find out a few things about the destination they are heading for. The app is available now and can be downloaded from Google Play Store - find it by entering ""Lufthansa Companion App"" in the search field.

And lets be honest, the habit to go online at every spare moment isnt just an American one were at it all over the world.;But people often get an inconsistent Wi-Fi e from venue to venue. Many hotels are cautious about investing in Wi-Fi, viewing it as another overhead that could impact profit margins. And while some are happy to invest and then give their customers Wi-Fi access for free, others stick on a charge, hoping to make costs back more quickly.;Judging by the Wakefield Research data (and the e of Zebra customers), investing in Wi-Fi and offering it for free is essential if you don't want unhappy guests.;The problem is that 3G and 4G coverage is often patchy, especially within larger buildings, or in more remote locations. So it's not surprising that hotelchatter.com reports that 94% of guests see Wi-Fi as the single most important amenity offered by hotels.;Even without statistics to make the case, the sight of so many people using smartphones shows just how much we rely on our mobile devices. After all, how do you feel when there's no coverage for your smartphone?;It's clear that Wi-Fi is an essential service for guests and, to prevent them from choosing a competitor venue, it should be free of charge.;But Zebra customers have found that reliable Wi-Fi is more than just a way of stopping guests getting fed up. They are using it as a valuable source of competitive advantage a real differentiator that persuades guests to choose them first.;Offering Wi-Fi alone isnt enough. It's all about the coverage and the reliability of the connection. A poor Wi-Fi service is almost worse than none at all, because the e doesn't match guest e.;Lets get technical for a moment. The challenge for hotels is the particular demand that guest Wi-Fi places on the network. Computer networks don't like change, and with guests moving around and coming and going, the wireless system has to cope with a constant stream of connections and disconnections.;Many guests these days travel with a personal smartphone and a company smartphone, as well as a laptop computer and a tablet. At different times all these devices will be connecting to the wireless network.;It's this constantly changing demand, as well as the sheer number of devices that they have to cope with, that makes hotel Wi-Fi services unreliable. And when the connections are made, guests are using bandwidth-hungry applications like video conferencing, music streaming and Skype.;Zebra Technologies has installed reliable, secure Wi-Fi in hotels all over the world. We've also helped many hoteliers improve their e Wi-Fi services.;Customers like these have recognised that dependable hotel Wi-Fi is a business-winning asset one that is as important as comfortable beds and a clean bathroom.;Business guests attending conferences can focus on their work, rather than worrying about the technology involved. Families with children can keep them amused with their favourite online games and TV programmes.;And these days, word of a great guest e can spread quickly via social media and the likes of TripAdvisor sites like these can have a powerful effect on the choices people make. The ; states that 61% of its 31,000 participants view the opinions of people like themselves (normal consumers) as a credible source of information about a brand.;So Wi-Fi is a must-have, not just an optional e.

This aircraft is considered the most advanced and most environmentally-friendly long-haul aircraft in the world. The possibilities offered by the on-board entertainment system on the A350-900 are likewise leading edge. For the first time, passengers will have the option of making a selection from the on-board program from home before setting off and adding their favorite items to a playlist.;To do this, all passengers need to do is load the ""Lufthansa Companion App"" onto their own tablet or mobile phone. The on-board program is available up to six weeks in advance. Once on board, passengers then synchronize their personal favorite playlist with the screen in front of the seat, and there is also the option to use the own mobile device as a second screen. During the flight, passengers can then choose something to watch from their favorites list, and at the same time call up flight information, go on social media websites via FlyNet, do a little online shopping in the WorldShop, or find out a few things about the destination they are heading for. The app is available now and can be downloaded from Google Play Store - find it by entering ""Lufthansa Companion App"" in the search field. The app will also soon be available in the Apple iTunes Store.;Lufthansa\'s entertainment program alone will be enough to stop passengers from getting bored. There is currently a choice of 100 movies, 200 TV programs, an e audio program with lots of CDs, playlists and audio books, games to play, and a children\'s section with lots of different films and music to choose from, plus information from the world of Lufthansa. Current news and sports reports from live TV channels can also be accessed via the seat screen or via the free FlyNet portal.;The flight information on offer also gives passengers an opportunity to try out a digital travel e in 3D. New interactive options make it possible to see the flight route in advance and to call up various different flight views.;The A350-900 also offers further improvements to comfort and convenience with larger screens for passengers in all classes. The user interface in the latest design provides passengers with a choice of ten different languages.;Lufthansa will be stationing the first ten Airbus A350-900 aircraft in Munich as of February 2017. The first destinations served will be Delhi and Boston. The aircraft can carry 293 passengers - 48 in Business Class, 21 in Premium Economy and 224 in Economy Class. The A350-900 is currently the world\'s most advanced and most environmentally-friendly long-haul aircraft.

Get the latest insight from leading Graphic Communications providers, including insights on direct mail, book publishing and transpromo. For Matrix Imaging Services, a provider of document processing services, the goal was simple: add color impact and personalization to transactional statements and promotional direct mailings at an affordable price. See how the Xerox Color 8250 Production Printer helped to create new workflows and open new opportunities. According to market research, most printing serves either to help sell a product or communicate information to someone. In that conte, there are three things that are impacting and changing the way print customers, and in turn, their customers use print and print related services. There are different approaches to offering mobile service and some tie a printed piece to mobile solution. The first print technology to bridge the gap is QR codes, but some are starting to say that NFC or field communication might have greater potential than QR codes. Direct marketing provides enormous opportunities and potential for profitability. But becoming a strategic partner for your clients means more than just adding services and offerings. It is critical to have a sales team in place capable of selling these services. Katie Dunn, President and Founder of Digital Innovations Group, discussed the 7 steps to successfully selling direct marketing services in a recent Thought Leadership Workshop. The Direct Marketing Association states the response rate of direct mail is more than 30x higher than that of email. You understand the benefits of direct marketing, but actually doing it and doing it well now that a completely different story! A recent Xerox Thought Leadership Workshop delved into everything-direct marketing. Included was a discussion of psychology based marketing and how to trigger the unconscious minds of your consumers, as well as the art and science of selling direct marketing services. We discuss some of the insight shared in Part I of our recap. See how two print and marketing service providers have found growth by aggregating production volume from small and medium-sized businesses that share industry-specific marketing needs. With over 6 million SMBs in the United States, opportunities e for those that can target verticals in a systematic way, all while offering value-added services. QR Codes are everywhere, but that not necessarily a good thing. From QR codes on billboards to codes on women backsides, it really makes us wonder, were people thinking? Ne time one of your clients wants to add a QR Code to a marketing piece, here are some things to watch for so their QR Code doesn end up on the ne list of QR Code Fails. Personalized communications can help your clients stand apart and differentiate themselves in today crowded and highly competitive marketplace. This was also the case for a student competing for class president, who chose to use personalized chewing gum as a way to push the envelop and capture the attention of his audience. We take a look at the opportunities available through personalized packaging, and how this student uncovered two uses for his personalized gum. You provide your customers many benefits through your digital print capabilities, but how can you be sure that your customers of today and tomorrow know about your many other services and offerings? A self-promotional direct marketing campaign can demonstrate your capabilities first hand.

As a result of this achievement, Entrepreneur magazine, a leading business publication for and about entrepreneurs, has named Sears Carpet & Upholstery Care the nation\'s eighth top new franchise opportunity. ""We are thrilled with the success of our carpet and upholstery care franchising strategy,"" said John Hassey, president, Sears Carpet & Upholstery Care. ""Sears will continue to move forward with building our franchise network and providing new business opportunities to qualified parties. By the end of 2001, Sears intends to secure franchise partners in California, Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Te and Virginia, enabling us to provide our unique Ultra Care System to more than 70 percent of the United States."" In less than two years, Sears Carpet & Upholstery Care has become one of the industry\'s leading competitors through its Ultra Care System cleaning process and dedication to customer service. The multi-step Ultra Care System is the cornerstone of Sears Carpet & Upholstery Care\'s success. While many competitors rely on a single-step clean-and-rinse method, the Sears Ultra Care cleaning process offers a technologically-advanced, dual-step carpet and upholstery care system. ""Our deep-cleaning, clean-rinsing, dual-step process thoroughly removes cleaning agents and dirt from carpet and upholstery,"" said Hassey. ""The typical one-step process leaves cleaning agents on the carpet, which attracts dirt after it dries."" Sears is offering this process through franchise agreements with select local service providers. To ensure consistent, quality service, Sears franchisees agree to work e as Sears service providers, adhering to strict Sears service guidelines under 10-year commitments. The combination of a superior product and Sears\' dedication to quality customer service has resulted in a strong customer satisfaction vehicle.

Despite the overwhelming volume of documents across all university departments, many institutions have yet to make the transition away from manual, paper-based processes that ultimately increase costs and decrease productivity. These document-intensive processes that dominate universities across the country stand in stark contrast to the increasingly fast-paced, digital world in which students live. College students have unlimited access to information at their fingertips and they e the same speed of accessibility to their educational records. With that said, universities across the country are embarking on digital transformation to keep up with the demands of their student body. Xerox is addressing this challenge with the release of seven new Xerox workflow solutions for higher education that transform repetitive, error-prone and tedious tasks into highly accurate and automated processes that save time and money. The value of these seven workflow solutions for higher education lies not only in the proven time and cost savings, but also in the increased student satisfaction and improved student e they create campus-wide.

Developers are intrigued with the possibility of deploying infrastructure in minutes rather than weeks. Containers also allow developers to define the infrastructure needed for their applications and ensure that each time their application is deployed it gets the same resources no matter the environment. Containers do not provide the same level of isolation as virtual machines. A VM has an entire operating system to itself that believes its installed on its own (virtual) hardware. It must share resources with the other VMs running on the same host, but the hypervisor pro access to physical resources. A container has only the binaries and libraries defined as required available to it, and runs on the same (Linux) kernel as other containers. The kernel pro access to physical resources like it does any other user mode process. Cgroups and namespaces provides isolation. For environments where high security or guaranteed performance is required, this is not a sufficient level of isolation.;Speed of deployment is one of the main drivers for adoption of containers. Because of the light level of isolation, containers can be deployed very quickly. Rather than provisioning an entire virtual server and installing an operating system, when deploying a container we need only define the container parameters and download any libraries we might be missing. KVM developers want to help users enjoy the benefits of both technologies by making VM deployments as speedy as containers. That means we want to pre-empt as much as possible so a responsive Operating System is available as soon as possible after provisioning.;By far, the bulk of the conversation about KVM development in 2016/2017 was about improving I/O performance. As I mentioned, Im new to Red Hat but not new to virtualization. I find a lot of my conversations about virtualization with customers inevitably lead to a discussion of I/O performance. There are a few different tracks of development related to I/O performance. KVM-rt is the KVM Realtime work. Some notable sessions that addressed this topic include:;Security is a theme woven into the fabric of the KVM project.;A number of sessions throughout the 3-day forum were focused on where KVM is going. For a community driven project like KVM, the roadmap isnt just about features and bug fi, its also about how the community can work together better. How can we be more efficient communicating, reviewing and accepting patches?;The KVM developer community is very accepting. Perhaps a few folks reading will chuckle at that statement. Im sure submitting patches can be frustrating at times as with any large project. But in my short e interacting with folks, everyone was quick to share informationand were very open to e development concepts to a server guy.;The only accurate documentation in a project like KVM is the code. Ive since gone back to the C programming language, refreshing my development skills so I can better understand whats happening. When looking for details about the new developments in KVM, the best place to go to, is the code. The beautiful thing about KVM as a virtualization platform is that everything is out in the open. That provides users with some powerful abilities in terms of understanding performance, troubleshooting issues.;There continues to be a vibrant community focused on virtualization. There are of course some very large organizations contributing to KVM, but the lions share of code comes from independent developers. That makes for a lively community producing great code!;Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:; You are commenting using your WordPress.com account. ; You are commenting using your Twitter account. ; You are commenting using your Facebook account. ; You are commenting using your Google+ account. ;Connecting to %s; ; ; ; your email address to follow the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.;Join 1,804 other followers; 2017 Red Hat;Powered by """,redhat,1,30,132.633,0.2,-0.65,y,y,y,n,n,0.0079746882,0.0062966334,0.0030284165,-0.0616063592,-0.0209522603,4195,308,7.3420738975,40.48,n,n,n,n,y,4,3,5,1,2

Do you think Millennials are the kids? Think again. They grew up during the rise of the Internet; it became their second language. However, my generation is growing up in a time when the Internet and technology are central to our lives. We are natives of the Internet. This will only be advantageous in the workplace. Always being alert of my phone means I can respond to emails, te and phone calls immediately; communication is key. Z has the potential to be a tremendous workforce. Jordan Hiken, Xerox intern And with more technology comes more information and knowledge. Gen Z will be the most productive generation due to the immense amount of information available to them at the click of a button. Tasks will get done faster and more accurately. Social media will also play a huge role in the Gen Z workforce. We will take full advantage of all that social media has to offer and build tremendous relationships with customers. Growing up during a period of much uncertainty the 9/11attacks , the economic recession, and changing social norms Gen Z motives are not purely monetary. These society-altering events also left us a little bit insecure. Personal contentment and bettering the world are things that we look for in a job. reports that 76 percent of us want to turn our hobby into a full time job, and 60 percent want our jobs to impact the world. (Hopefully in a positive way.) Rather than working for others, we have an entrepreneurial spirit; as much as we want to better the world, we want to make some money along the way. I like to think that we are mature, self-directed, and resourceful. For GenZ, I see a very bright light at the end of the tunnel. and receive email updates when we publish a new article.

The satellite terminal is also a continuation of the successful joint venture between Munich Airport and Lufthansa. As in Terminal 2, the partners have joined forces to design, build and finance the new passenger handling facility on a 60:40 basis. The Munich architectural firm Koch + Partner was selected for the design and general planning.;The new facility will give Munich Airport 27 new gate positions where passengers can board aircraft directly without bus transportation. With the new satellite facility, the capacity of Terminal 2, which is used by Lufthansa and its Star Alliance partners, will be increased by 11 million to 36 million passengers per year. As one of the world's most advanced passenger facilities, the satellite terminal will offer passengers pleasant surroundings with a wide range of shopping and dining options in attractive and spacious areas flooded with natural light. Passengers will also have five new Lufthansa lounges to choose from.;The satellite has no direct landside transportation links. Check-in will take place in Terminal 2. Passengers will then undergo passport screening and hand baggage checks before boarding the airport's own underground transport system that will take them to the satellite terminal in barely a minute.

The architecture, the shopping options and the wide variety of foods and drinks available reflect the Bavarian lifestyle and Munich's unique character. The satellite also features plenty of services to meet the needs and desires of the modern traveller, including quiet areas with reclining chairs, play areas for children, changing tables in the men's and women's washrooms, and four showers. All services are situated at the center of the new building for quick and convenient access by customers. From here the five new Lufthansa lounges are just steps away.

TLS 1.1 and 1.2 became the need of the hour and NetScaler quickly responded back by implementing the support in MPX appliances. Now, NetScaler MPX-FIPS platform also becomes stronger with support of TLS 1.1/1.2 protocol. MPX-FIPS platforms are used in sensitive deployments where data security is critical and all such deployments can avail the new support now.;When I saw the 2014 biopic ;which is set in World War II, I was astonished to see how Alan Turing successfully broke the super strong ciphers created by the Enigma machine, which the Nazis used to secure their wireless messages. His efforts were helpful in saving thousands of lives around the world.;In the modern conte, sensitive data, from credit card numbers to patient health information to social networking details, need protection when transmitted across an insecure network. Data with defence and federal agencies are considered even more sensitive and thus they need stronger cryptographic infrastructure. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) mandates such agencies to comply with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) to meet their strict security requirements.;The FIPS Publication 140-2 is a U.S. government computer security standard used to accredit cryptographic modules. To coordinate the requirements and standards for cryptography modules including both hardware and software, the NIST issued the FIPS 140 Publication Series.;Citrix NetScaler comes in FIPS variant as well which is in compliance with FIPS 140-2 level 2. It provides organizations with additional security by protecting unauthorized access to cryptographic keys, which if misappropriated could result in a data security breach.;NetScaler FIPS appliance are available in four form factors with Pay-as-You-Grow model. These are MPX 9700/10500/12500/15500.;SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 both have vulnerabilities in their implementation. These vulnerabilities were e by various attacks like POODLE and BEAST. SSL 3.0 is becoming obsolete now and TLS 1.0 is not secure enough considering the advancement in processing and computing power. Large ciphers can also be broken now which were practically impossible to do earlier.;The security issues with SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 are addressed by TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2. It is recommended by NIST that government servers and clients should move to TLS 1.1 and 1.2.;Government is taking proactive steps in terms of security of data and NIST has asked the federal agencies to move to TLS 1.2 before Oct 1 2015.;NetScaler FIPS appliances start supporting TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 protocols from 10.5.e MR build 55.8007.e, released in Q2 2015. This will result in the product to comply with the NIST mandate for federal agencies to use TLS 1.2 from October 2015 and enables NetScaler to be successfully deployed in government organizations. Already deployed NetScaler FIPS appliances shall be upgraded to this build or later to support TLS 1.2 and continue its glorious run in the government sector.;As always NetScaler evolves itself and keeps its customers in a win-win situation. So, beat the trepidation, unsureness and dilemma and start using TLS 1.1/1.2 with NetScaler FIPS appliances.;Important details once more ;TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 support on NetScaler FIPS appliances.;Build 10.5 55.8007.e;Download link ;P.S.

I would have thought we all want to be respected as individuals by the retailers we buy from. For me, that's the bottom line of personalisation: treating people like people.;It's one of the cornerstones of any loyalty strategy. The more retailers can understand their customers, the better the service they can provide, and the more willing customers will be to buy regularly.;Coincidentally, Zebra's own research (EMEA Shoppers Survey, 2015) shows that 79% of customers the same 79%? are happy to share at least some personal data with retailers.;As consumers, we're becoming more marketing-savvy. We understand that if we give information to retailers about our tastes and preferences, we're more likely to be offered choices that are relevant and valuable.;The danger is that personalisation turns into intrusion. Building a loyalty strategy is a masterclass in tightrope walking. How can you let customers know you care?;It's about balancing attentive, personalised service against the risk of becoming a pestering nuisance.;Zebra is working with a number of retailers on the ways they gather data from digital sources. They're using Zebra in-store wireless, card printers and scanners to learn as much as they can about their customers' tastes, preferences and shopping habits.;RFID solutions from Zebra also feed into the data pool, giving real-time information about which items are moving off the shelves faster. RFID data can also show patterns of sale, such as the time of day when certain lines sell more than others, or the effect of a special offer on sales volumes.;This wealth of information can feed directly into an analytics ecosystem that can interpret the data in infinite variations. In the process, the patterns and profiles emerge that enable retailers to walk the tightrope of loyalty and personalisation with surefooted success.;As a consumer, I have my favourite retailers, but I don't want them to behave like needy friends. You know the kind; they always seem to call at the most inconvenient time, or persuade you to borrow DVDs you have no intention of watching.;What I want is a trusted advisor there when I need them, and perhaps occasionally inviting me to try something new. Their timing will always be perfect, and the new things they offer will be based on a genuine understanding of what I like.;The Zebra One Store solution enables this kind of personalised e. The name One Store was conceived to flip the idea of 'omnichannel retail' round and view the shopping e from the consumer's perspective.;One Store allows retailers to capture data from multiple channels and gain a full understanding of how each individual customer interacts with them.;I envisage a scenario in which I download an app that makes it easier to browse a retailer's online store and see the products I want. I can also use it to check that stock is available at my local branch.;When I arrive, I connect to the guest Wi-Fi and the app guides me through the shop to the items I'm looking for.;Then, as I pass down a particular aisle, I get a message offering a price reduction on the lines I'm about to see products that may not have been on my list for the day, but are certainly relevant and interesting, based on my past purchases and browsing habits.;Perhaps the ultimate personalised e would be for a member of staff to be there in the aisle and welcome me by name, inviting me to take up the offer. It would have to be handled with care, but a good retail sales specialist should be well-practised at putting people at their ease.;It's the ideal balance of digital services with the classic retail e.;And it's the great paradox of technology. Amid all the concerns about the digital barriers between us, it's actually allowing us to be more human, with sensitive personalised shopping e that engender lasting loyalty.; Topics: ;, ;, ;, ; """,zebra,7,29,145.503,0,-0.25,y,y,n,n,n,0.0021589545,0.0095981976,-0.0367778768,-0.0789507697,-0.0122814668,4052,332,8.1934846989,37.61,n,n,y,y,y,4,3,5,1,2

I not just bragging. The Business Marketing Association has recognized our Brother Dominic commercial as the winner of the 2017 Best Broadcast Advertising Single Spot in their Global ACE Awards. Earlier this year, our the Page Free campaign scored a win in the Internet Advertising Competition Global ACE Awards. which launched on January 4, has garnered over 56 million impressions across broadcast TV, Connected TV and digital media. With a total of 9.6 million video views to-date on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter it is our new record as the No. 1 most viewed video in Xerox history 3 times our prior video view record. won Best B2B Integrated Ad Campaign in the 2017 Internet Advertising Competition (IAC) Awards. Among the metrics: A lift in brand ad recall of 53.4 percent, which is a best-in-class Google benchmark. Brother Dominic sets the page free and helps @Xerox snag two awards. These awards recognize the power of the Brother Dominic film, and the relevance of the messages it delivers about how Xerox is the way the world communicates, connects and works, as well as the momentum and impact delivered by an integrated campaign. I tempted to say this is a miraculous outcome. In fact, it the result of hard work and inspiration from the Xerox Advertising & Media team and our agency partners Y&R, VML and MEC. Their creative ingenuity brought back Brother Dominic after a 40-year hiatus to demonstrate the power and relevance of Xerox. The idea behind setting the page free is not new. It what Xerox has been doing since we introduced the first copier, which automated the task of duplication and freed operators from a slow and laborious process. But don let our history limit your imagination. The page is more than paper. Setting the page free transcends both the physical and digital, liberates the way we use and share information, and enables each of us to be more productive. The phrase nods to our heritage, reflects our present and embraces our future. In order to be free, some pages may need to: Our breakthrough technologies including digital printing, printed electronics, intelligent packaging and direct-to-object print are already solving many of these challenges. Brother Dominic has come a long way in 40 years. The original Brother Dominic needed to make 500 copies of his manuscript. The new Brother Dominic must do that plus translate it into 35 languages, personalize each one, and then share with colleagues around the world on paper, smartphones and even a coffee mug. It would take a miracle for one person to get it all done. Lucky for Brother Dominic, that what we do here at Xerox: Set the page free, enabling our customers to perform their own miracles every day. The Global ACE Awards is the longest running B-to-B award program and recognizes the year top creative campaigns, the inspired talent who conceived them, and the agencies and clients who have successfully elevated brand and driven demand. The New York Times has hailed the awards as of the industry best creative awards. (Last year winners were GE & IBM so we are in good company.) The IAC Awards are the first and only industry-based advertising award competition dedicated e to online digital advertising. These awards recognize outstanding online advertising in varying forms including online ads, video, mobile, newsletter, email and social media, and includes both the creative, as well as paid media activation. As Dominic needs have evolved over the past forty years, so has Xerox ability to continually delight with relevant products and solutions. ad campaign does an amazing job of seamlessly integrating a hoary past with the technology advancements of the present and the future! me with suspenseful anticipation about what Brother Dominic and Xerox would be doing forty years from now!

Yesterday returned after a too-long hiatus, and so did one of my favorite characters the Xerox 914. It was a big deal (literally) when it first arrived, back in the first episode of season two: She right it was a big piece of technology at the start. As the world very first fully automated, plain-paper copier, it initially weighed a whopping 648 pounds. In this episode, the copier spent several days sitting in the middle of the office (and being curiously gawked at by the agency employees), before being relocated to copywriter Peggy office, much to her dismay especially when she walked in to find one of the ad men copying his face. Not surprisingly, Ned the Xerox repairman was not too happy about this misuse of the machinery (see above video). The Xerox 914 was more than just a piece of new technology for these ad e; it , making it significantly faster to duplicate documents (be it advertisements or otherwise) and making everyone office lives a whole lot easier. Tina Brown, editor-in-chief of Newsweek, even in her column in last week 60s-inspired special issue. When looking back on some of the things that made a splash in Newsweek 1960s coverage, she writes, office psychodramas in Men ran parallel with a serial melodrama in the news that covered with panache the dominance of that new tech phenomenon the Xerox machine. Printers and copiers have certainly gotten a lot lighter, faster and more multi-function since the debut of the Xerox 914, but Xerox still remains an important member of the office staff through offerings like managed print services (MPS). In fact, Xerox was just named the in a recent IDC report. We helped businesses save millions of dollars by offering the tools, support, security and processes to simplify the way work is done and uncover hidden print costs. I hope that I get to see more of the Xerox 914 this season maybe it will even help win a new account for my friends at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Thought you would find this interesting.

Just walking around my house caused my feet and heels to ache, and I was afraid I was going to end up dying young. I had tried every diet out there and even thought about getting gastric bypass surgery. But I was afraid of the recovery and complications, not to mention the cost of the surgery.;At over 376 pounds I was sure that I just couldnt do it on my own. I ended up in the ER one night. The doctor told me I had a heart murmur and was pre-diabetic. He advised me to begin taking better care of myself and losing some weight.

But I was so tired of popping Motrin like candy, and my stomach was constantly aching from to the overuse of pain relievers.;A few weeks later I was watching ; on TV. I saw that the heaviest woman they had ever had on the show was almost as big as I was! I thought to myself, If she could do this, I had to at least try one more time.

That, in a nutshell, is what behind the recent resurgence in printed catalogs. A recent Xerox-InfoTrends research study found that nearly seven out of 10 consumers consult catalogs before purchases. The same study found that transactions are three times larger when catalogs are personalized and relevant to the recipient as a result, 68 percent of catalogers are seeking personalization solutions. The power of data, combined with new production capabilities associated with inkjet technology, is transforming the customer e for retailers and opening up new areas for revenue generation. These technological advancements are bringing new hope to champions of . Rather than sending static or versioned catalogs, the economies and capabilities enabled by inkjet printing are making it feasible for retailers to add personalization and relevancy to catalog covers, inserts and offers. Depending on mailing circulation, these can be produced either entirely on digital production devices or as hybrid solutions with digital and offset presses. Among the new technology advancements helping enable personalized catalogs: The , available today, and , releasing later this year. This new ink set is notable as it delivers a wider color gamut and dramatic visual resolution that, when combined with commodity offset coated papers, puts more high-quality jobs within the reach of inkjet production. It important to note that these inks help achieve brilliant, offset-like image quality without pre- or post-coating processes or specialty heads. One of the original pioneers of the personalized catalog is , a Germany-based international retailer with more than 32 million customers in 29 countries. While the retailer employs a multichannel approach that spans online, print and retail, it is their printed catalog that represents their most critical channel 220 million copies are distributed annually with 69% of online shoppers consulting the catalog first. Bonprix began personalizing its catalogs after running a test campaign comparing a traditional static catalog with one that was personalized to present relevant offers based upon the recipient purchase history. Key results included 500% higher response rates from current customers and 400% higher response rates from inactive customers. Many print providers are interested in bringing these opportunities to catalogers.

With such variability in production, the need for collaboration between humans and smart manufacturing technology is essential. Working side by side on a daily basis, process compliance plays an integral role in ensuring both the safety of workers and the quality of the final product meet the necessary standards. These standards are driven by legislation, regulatory bodies and company/product specifications. Adhering to defined e in the manufacturing of large quantities of product presents a significant challenge, and forms the basis for the technological opportunity. ;As humans and technology continue to work closely together, process compliance difficulties arise and must be met with a clear integration strategy. Managing a massive product variety while adhering to compliance processes can be difficult, particularly as the variables regularly change to meet the needs of man and machine.;Personalisation is now a key trend across manufacturing: first in food (customised M&Ms anyone?) and now moving into larger fast moving consumer goods. Nikes sports footwear for e, allows consumers to design and buy the e trainers they want; people are now seeking out things made specially for them. This is occurring on an even bigger scale as well! Take the Vau Adam - it has over 1 million variants, the Citroen DS3 offers 3 million combinations and the 2015 Dodge Viper and Viper SRT can be one of a kind cars with a staggering 25 million possible configurations. Indeed, if building things wasnt already complex, its becoming more so!;This variety complicates the on-boarding process. Staff must learn an ever-growing quantity of build configurations that then must be adhered to as the variety of products intensifies. This growth increases the risk of mistakes and non-compliance.;As manufacturers look to achieve ever-closer union between humans and machines while maintaining process compliance, many in the industry are attempting to redesign their operations to safely accommodate this closer relationship. These developments are being further advanced through the growth of technology across the production process. New innovations are driving improved product quality, traceability, fle, repeatability and agility, ensuring optimal ROI and compliance.;With the implementation of new technologies across manufacturing operations, process compliance is being simplified as data on information management relating to condition and process is becoming easier to access. With clear instructions included on the actions to take in the result of non-compliance, the people working with the machines have the capability to resolve errors quickly and efficiently. Technology manufacturers such as Zebra look to enable manufacturers to take that technology step, be that a new or, deeper step into technology. Whatever the case, scalability is the key so that the investment can be staggered as the organisation grows.;When a manufacturer is driven by its customer to comply with a product specification and deliver those products on a just in time basis, they will often look to establish pinch points and identify compliance challenges. This is where technology becomes an enabler. With the right equipment in place, the system can ensure clear instructions are visible to operators across multiple devices, both static and mobile, to drive efficient data sharing, collaboration and performance.;In reality the manufacturing landscape is rapidly adopting a new approach towards process compliance. Reactivity is no longer good enough. With high profile errors showcased across the globe in the form of the automotive emissions scandal and the horse meat debacle, manufacturers are now looking towards pro-activity. Pre-empting and mitigating non-compliance has the potential to increase sales volume, heighten brand image and consolidate confidence in production capability. These are true benefits few manufacturers can afford to turn their back on.;Working together, humans and machines have the potential to drive enhanced productivity throughout the manufacturing process, while adhering to process compliance.

That service would be too e for most consumers, forcing them to do without. Enterprise IT applications are beginning to emulate the user-friendly apps that non-technical people use every day. head of Xerox Global Workflow Automation and General Manager for Xerox DocuShare In other words, it would be something like enterprise IT applications, which typically require professionals to install, program and maintain them many small and medium size businesses (SMBs) to do without. But that changing. Enterprise IT applications are beginning to emulate the user-friendly apps that non-technical people use every day on their mobile devices and laptops. This move to consumerization makes it easier for SMB workers to meet their individual needs in highly personal ways, without an IT department. Among the applications leading the consumerization charge: enterprise content management (ECM) systems. These systems provide centralized management of digital documents, while enabling digitization and automation of many document-related processes. So, for e, if you needed to pull together all of your records about a particular client or on a specific topic including financial spreadsheets, emails, Web posts, and Word documents an ECM does it for you. It provides a structured way to organize all of an enterprise documents in all their digital forms in a searchable, centralized repository. No more tedious searching through multiple disconnected systems. Cloud content management for the digital workplace. Moreover, common document workflows for tasks like managing approval processes can be automated, ensuring that everyone who needs to see a document sees it at the right time, in its most current form. With a little advanced planning, automation can even help you locate disparate documents relating to a given topic. You simply automate your retention policies for documents on that topic, and the ECM system will collect and store them for future retrieval. Think of the time you could save responding to an audit, to say nothing of how finding information more quickly could accelerate customer service, workplace collaboration and a host of other activities. Yet SMBs tend to lack centralized storage of digital information, often relying instead on inefficient paper-based systems. According to respondents to a 2016 Association for Information and Image Management (AIIM) survey, poor content management practices result in taking too long to find content (62 percent), duplicated efforts (52 percent) and insufficient re-use (46 percent) . Managing digital documents, and the data they contain, just got easier and cheaper. https:/ctt.ec/a+ pic.twitter.com/uAK0Aw4438 The consumerization trend is poised to change that, and the cloud is a key contributor. With the cloud, the system technology is managed off-site by a third party offloading the requirements for system integration, updates and maintenance that are the realm of the IT professional. The cloud also contributes to making these systems more affordable, permitting SMBs and departments to control costs by ordering only the service level they require. The way users interface with the technologies onsite is also critical to consumerization. For e, our new cloud-based , was re-engineered from the ground up to make user interactions simple and intuitive, while delivering the power and full functionality of large-scale ECM systems. Its 100-percent Web-based user interface enables users to start right in using the application with little or no training. It also mobile-ready to run on a wide range of browsers and mobile devices and wherever the user needs it. And searches can be as straightforward as those in any Web-based browser, with advanced search options available, as well. Just as critically, the system automation tools and content rules are designed for easy programming by business users. No more calling in IT pros whenever you want to automate a process from scratch, or tweak it to more closely match your work style. It not quite as easy as recording a TV program, but it getting there.

I not just bragging. The Business Marketing Association has recognized our Brother Dominic commercial as the winner of the 2017 Best Broadcast Advertising Single Spot in their Global ACE Awards. Earlier this year, our the Page Free campaign scored a win in the Internet Advertising Competition Global ACE Awards. which launched on January 4, has garnered over 56 million impressions across broadcast TV, Connected TV and digital media. With a total of 9.6 million video views to-date on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter it is our new record as the No. 1 most viewed video in Xerox history 3 times our prior video view record. won Best B2B Integrated Ad Campaign in the 2017 Internet Advertising Competition (IAC) Awards. Among the metrics: A lift in brand ad recall of 53.4 percent, which is a best-in-class Google benchmark. Brother Dominic sets the page free and helps @Xerox snag two awards. These awards recognize the power of the Brother Dominic film, and the relevance of the messages it delivers about how Xerox is the way the world communicates, connects and works, as well as the momentum and impact delivered by an integrated campaign. I tempted to say this is a miraculous outcome. In fact, it the result of hard work and inspiration from the Xerox Advertising & Media team and our agency partners Y&R, VML and MEC. Their creative ingenuity brought back Brother Dominic after a 40-year hiatus to demonstrate the power and relevance of Xerox. The idea behind setting the page free is not new. It what Xerox has been doing since we introduced the first copier, which automated the task of duplication and freed operators from a slow and laborious process. But don let our history limit your imagination. The page is more than paper. Setting the page free transcends both the physical and digital, liberates the way we use and share information, and enables each of us to be more productive. The phrase nods to our heritage, reflects our present and embraces our future. In order to be free, some pages may need to: Our breakthrough technologies including digital printing, printed electronics, intelligent packaging and direct-to-object print are already solving many of these challenges. Brother Dominic has come a long way in 40 years. The original Brother Dominic needed to make 500 copies of his manuscript. The new Brother Dominic must do that plus translate it into 35 languages, personalize each one, and then share with colleagues around the world on paper, smartphones and even a coffee mug. It would take a miracle for one person to get it all done. Lucky for Brother Dominic, that what we do here at Xerox: Set the page free, enabling our customers to perform their own miracles every day. The Global ACE Awards is the longest running B-to-B award program and recognizes the year top creative campaigns, the inspired talent who conceived them, and the agencies and clients who have successfully elevated brand and driven demand. The New York Times has hailed the awards as of the industry best creative awards. (Last year winners were GE & IBM so we are in good company.) The IAC Awards are the first and only industry-based advertising award competition dedicated e to online digital advertising. These awards recognize outstanding online advertising in varying forms including online ads, video, mobile, newsletter, email and social media, and includes both the creative, as well as paid media activation. As Dominic needs have evolved over the past forty years, so has Xerox ability to continually delight with relevant products and solutions. ad campaign does an amazing job of seamlessly integrating a hoary past with the technology advancements of the present and the future! me with suspenseful anticipation about what Brother Dominic and Xerox would be doing forty years from now!

He came to learn some new ideas on how to win over one specific prospect. However, when I asked some basic questions about this prospect, the Managing Director was unable to answer them. This e taught him a valuable lesson. If you want to convert a prospect, you need to know enough about them. An awful lot of printing companies seem to work on a different basis. They believe that the more people they contact, the more business they will win. But it is far more profitable to focus on specific types of prospect and really go the e mile to put yourself in their world. However, in order to be in their world, you need to understand it. Here are three sets of questions that you should be able to answer. These also refer to your best customers: Once you have this information you are able to reach out to prospects with a similar profile. You have a much better chance of engaging with them. You have a much better chance of successfully converting these prospects into clients. The answer is simple: talk to your current clients. Most of them will be only too happy to help you.

It is one of the world's largest conferences on the topic of digitization. With the eponymous FlyingLab SXSW, Lufthansa will introduce its guests on flight LH440 from Frankfurt to Houston on 9 March 2017 to the conference themes. On board an Airbus A380, everything will revolve around the impacts of digitization. High above the Atlantic, digital e will give fascinating insights into their subject areas. The 15-minute sessions range from transport in the future, to Smart Cities, and a useful survival guide for the ten SXSW conference days (10 to 19 March 2017). All participants of the Flying Lab SXSW will get access to the live video stream of the speakers, and the presentation documents, via WiFi on their smartphone, tablet or laptop - no matter where theyre sitting on the plane. Listeners can ask the speakers questions related to the presentations via their devices. This is how FlyingLab creates a dialogue on board that the participants can then continue with their seat neighbours after the presentations have finished, says Dr Torsten Wingenter, Senior Director Digital Innovations at Lufthansa. Every industry must think about how to use the opportunities of digitization for themselves. Airlines are no e to this.;Lufthansa has announced 2017 as the year of digitization, and the FlyingLab is a building block in this strategy. With this, Lufthansa is pursuing the strategy of fast prototyping. Relevant digitization topics will be used in the FlyingLabs to get direct feedback from the participants. So far, FlyingLabs have taken place on the topics of virtual reality as well as fashion & technology. A FlyingLab makes it possible to use travelling time much more efficiently. The programme is linked to the destination or an event at the final destination, e Dr Wingenter. In future, Lufthansa will open up the platform and offer FlyingLabs from third parties. It is conceivable that companies will use this to introduce their employees or customers to particular topics on the way to conferences, trade fairs and other events.;In addition to lectures, the FlyingLab SXSW also offers an elaborate test unit. There is enough time on the eleven hour flight to try out innovative technical devices at leisure. The selection includes video glasses, noise reducing earplugs and a smart ring. The Glyph video glasses from US manufacturer Avegant do not work using screens, LEDs project the video image over tiny mirrors using two lenses onto the viewers retinas. The earplugs from the Finnish manufacturer QuietOn reduce background noise by up to 40 decibels and the wearer doesnt have to adjust any complicated settings. The earpieces are wireless and their batteries provide up to 50 hours of noise cancellation. New York start-up Ringly presents a smart ring in the FlyingLab SXSW. The piece of jewelry signals incoming messages on your smartphone via vibration and colour patterns so you dont have to constantly keep an eye on the screen and yet you still dont miss a thing. In addition, Ringly also counts steps taken and calories burned by the wearer.;Taking part in the FlyingLab is free of charge.

On a recent Saturday afternoon, a Brooklyn man was e trouble with his home Internet service. After a couple of futile attempts to reboot the system, he called the service provider help line. A series of short vocal prompts led to a friendly voice that asked what the issue was. When the caller replied that his Internet wasn working, the agent reported that there were no outages in the area but would try to resolve the problem by sending a signal boost to the modem. The customer was instructed to hang up and call back in 10 minutes if the problem persisted. There was no need to call again. The agent action worked, and the caller was pleased to have his issue resolved with minimal e and no time on hold. Now here the thing: That friendly voice on the other end of the line wasn a person. It was an intelligent virtual agent (IVA). Apple Siri is the most famous of these computerized helpers, but more and more businesses are using their own IVAs to deal with customers, both via phone and live te chat. The technology consulting firm Gartner forecasted that, by ne year, 50 percent of customer service interactions will be conducted with IVAs. The trend makes sense, as there are several benefits to using virtual agents. Hold times are cut and assistance can be provided 24/7 for almost no additional cost to a company. Still, that convenience wouldn matter if a customer was left frustrated after an unproductive call. That the area where virtual agents have taken big steps. IVAs can take a description of symptoms and provide an accurate solution that is based on rapid analysis of company documents and prior interactions with other customers. And, in a world where social media is king, virtual agents have also gotten more social. Virtual agents now understand and respond to conversational language. For e, if a customer describes that his smartphone is too hot to touch, the IVA can deduce that the phone is overheating and then provide a solution based on millions of customer-agent interactions that have been filed in its system, combined with a customer profile. a customized process, says Tim Deluca-Smith, vice president of marketing at . the ability of the virtual agent to actually understand everything that is going through that system and to learn from it. actually saying, given the conte [of the customer issue], given the subscription he is on, given what he is trying to do, given who he is, given having seen this question asked historically, that it can provide the solution for a customer with a 99 percent degree of certainty. That accuracy stat is eye-popping, but the conversational element is just as important. Customers have often complained that interactions with virtual agents are stiff and awkward, and require e issues multiple times until the computer finally understands. That has changed. Make no mistake you won be having witty banter with a virtual agent, as if you were on a late-night talk show (well, ). But machines are now able to comprehend what customers are telling them based on a description of the symptoms not solely a list of keywords. So, as machines become more human-like, it brings up a burning question: Will computers take these customer service jobs away from people? things will not disappear overnight, says Deluca-Smith. they will change. In the future, the human role will focus more on maintenance of virtual agent systems and figuring out ways to further their development. And, skills will need to be developed to improve problem areas in companies and taking action on consumer habits based on the data that the agents are compiling. time an agent resolves a customer problem, that another learned interaction, says Deluca-Smith. machine remembers. For now, consumers can look forward to even faster, more accurate, stress-free service which will continue to shift their perception of virtual agent customer service. think we will get to a point that [customer] confidence is a lot higher, says Deluca-Smith. consumer [will have] confidence that he can ask a question, in his language, the way he speaks, and get an accurate response. It will be at that point that people will start to understand and embrace the automated channels.

A few drops of these potent powerhouses can have benefits for both the mind and body. Here, the lowdown on these wonder workers and how to use them: First, the basics. Essential oils are aromatic e that are e from plants and botanicals, e Amy Galper, E Director and Founder of the . Many essential oils are obtained via ; the plant material is enclosed in a special piece of equipment called a still (picture a vegetable steamer) that captures the steam and transforms it back into water. At that point, the oil from the plant floats on top and can be skimmed off. essential oils, namely those that come from citrus, are e through physical pressing. While you can apply fi oils (plant-based oils made up of fatty acid chains like jojoba, rosehip, avocado, coconut, olive, and grapeseed oils) directly to your skin, you should never (ever!) do the same with essential oils. These are concentrated plant essences, and can cause irritation particularly for those with sensitive skin, cautions Villecco. Always mix them with another unscented plant-based oil (known as a carrier oil); Galper suggests olive oil or coconut about three to five drops of essential oil per one tablespoon of the carrier oil should do it. And, it always worth testing the blend on a small area first, says Villecco. If you want to reap the aromatherapy benefits without applying anything to the skin, something as simple as taking a quick whiff directly from the bottle may do the trick, says Galper. Alternately, put a few drops on a cotton ball and keep it in a zip-top bag that you can easily stash in your purse or car. Or, mix and match a few different oils to create a , , or that will leave your comple glowing. Essential oils are also a great addition to any shower or bath; mix with a tablespoon of bath salts, or make your own with just a few simple ingredients. And the aromatherapy benefits go way beyond personal care. Combine essential oils with baking soda and vinegar for a , use them to , or create a natural room scent. Now that you know what they are and how they sourced, let talk about the benefits of essential oils, which are, in a word, endless. Galper calls them the quintessential holistic tools: work with the physical body when applied topically, and when you smell them they impact your emotional and spiritual self.

Much like the actual tournament itself, this field serves as a good comparison to see what strategies the industry is employing, how they found value in doing so, and how you can implement those successes into your everyday business. You provide your customers many benefits through your digital print capabilities, but how can you be sure that your customers of today and tomorrow know about your many other services and offerings? A self-promotional direct marketing campaign can demonstrate your capabilities first hand. See how CopyCat AS of Norway filled their open house event by capturing a 10% response rate and 50% conversation rate with an integrated cross-media campaign. Today is March 14 (3.14), also known as National Pi Day. Xerox has found a fun way to celebrate, highlighted by a print application produced on the Xerox Color 550/560 Printer, containing over 500,000 digits of pi, all of which are 1/100th of an inch in height. This sample demonstrates unique specialty imaging security print technologies such as MicroTe, and discusses their real-world usages. In-plant print professionals gathered to discuss various strategies and success stories for how they are overcoming challenges in transforming their in-house shops into high-powered marketing machines, bridging the print and digital worlds by leveraging social media, multi-channel communications and big data trends. According to a Wall Street Journal article, the death of printed books may have been e. While e-book initial popularity was helped by early adopters transitioning to the medium in a concentrated period, further converts may prove harder to come by.

You hear me?;Those were the words whispered to me on November 4, 2013, and they shaped the last year of my life. You see, that was the day I was rolled back into an operating room for a gastric bypass surgery. Everyone was scared of what would happen once I came out of surgery. The doctor was preparing everyone for the possibility that I would wind up in the ICU for a couple days or longer.;It was a surgery that not only saved my life, but gave me a new body and a new lease on life. I never went to the ICU. Though I had no major complications from the surgery and my recovery was a breeze, that comment about fighting has stuck with me this last year. It has become my motivation and my credo.;No matter what happens, each and every day I need to fight. I need to fight to get my body back.;One year ago, my life was miserable. I weighed 512lbs and everything hurt. I can remember not being able to fit into chairs and the constant worry that one would break as soon as I sat down on it. Work was overly difficult. I was dejected and depressed.;Something needed to change. I was sick and tired of being sick and tired.;Then something truly amazing happened to me. My mom sat me down one day and told me that she was so concerned for my health, and that if I chose to have weight-loss surgery she would pay for whatever my insurance didnt cover. Then a close friend told me how concerned he was for me and how I used to be so full of life. For some reason, I was shocked. My mother was willing to pay thousands of dollars just to get her son back. It floored me.;At this point, I started to fully realized I was a shell of the person I once was. I was capable of so much more and I had let it all slip away.;The biggest thing I was concerned about, and probably spent even more time studying than anything, was the diet and e requirements post-surgery. I knew my life would be changing, but I had no clue just how much. The typical post weight-loss surgery patient will be on less than 600 800 calories a day. With so few calories going in, I was also required to do some physical e for an hour every day.;I needed a way to track every bit of food and e I was doing every day, and if I wasnt careful with a fine balance of calories in verses calories out, I would get lightheaded, dizzy, and feel really sick. I needed to keep my calorie intake/output ; right. This has been my dance every day for the last year.;That is where the ; came into the picture. After some research, I knew that the ; had the features that would best meet my needs. It had the ability to track my steps in a day, it could take into account the variety of e I was doing, and it based the number of calories burned on my height and weight. Plus I knew it would be more accurate than most devices on the market.;It also gave me the ability to log the food I was eating with a large database of foods, restaurants, and the calories for all of them. With my Flex, I have been able to carefully navigate those often stormy waters of calories in and calories out as I continue to ramp up my training. It will play an even more integral role in maintaining that delicate balance.;Since I started this amazing journey, I have lost almost 210 lbs. In the last year I have gone from couch potato to athlete. I have walked a 5K and a 10K, got my first road bike and my longest race to date has been 38 miles. I did a -mile swim in the Ohio River and placed 6; in my age group.;These are all amazing things, but I have even more planned. I feel as if Im just waking up from a bad dream. I want to run my first 5K and 10K in the ne 6 months. Then a half marathon at the ; this ne year, and hopefully a full marathon at the ; in 2016. Other future goals? The Cincinnati Triathlon, a half Ironman race in 2016, and a full Ironman in 2017.;And my ultimate goal: a 585-mile single-track mountain bike trail.;These personal goals are to prove to myself that my body is capable of so much more than I ever thought possible. I spent so much time neglecting it that I now want to see what it is truly capable of.;I want to prove that anyone out there can take back their lives; it just takes a choice. I am not special. Im just some regular guy that made the choice to get healthy. I want to help motivate others to greatness.; ; Comments ; ; Please note: Comments are moderated and may not appear immediately after submission. ;Your email address will not be published.

Comments have a hard time sticking to healthy eating when I get sugar cravings. Im reducing the amount of sugar in my meals, but by the end of the day I want something sweet. Any recommendations on how to satisfy the sugar cravings without derailing my goal to lose weight?;Hi Allie, My sister went through the same where she cut all Added- Sugar intake in her diet to prevent diabetes that runs in the family. She went through a lot of mood swings and depression at the beginning, but is now completely sugar-free and loving it! I think it would have helped if you reduce the amount of sugar in your tea, cakes etc gradually every week so that your taste buds get accustomed to the new taste and flavour. Hope this helps!;Thanks for your feedback. I gradually stopped the added sugar in my coffee and youre right it helped and now I am sugar free. Ill try that approach with my other foods,;I have a friend who has done the same thing. She rewards herself with a couple pieces of dark chocolate at the end of the day. Delicious and healthy!;Thank you for this article. I am a former Weight Watcher member as well as Weight Watcher leader who put back on all the weight I had lost once I stopped attending the meetings. I bought my first Fitbit (Fitbit one) in January 2015 and carried it in my picket with a daily step goal of 5000. It was hard for me to reach that goal. I lost that Fitbit in January 2016 and within 24 hours had purchased the Charge HR and left the goal set at 10,000 steps. Since that time, I have reached the goal of 10,000 more days than not and last week raised my goal to 12,000. I have lost 15 pounds and gone down 3 pant sizes! I still log all of my foodgood and bad choices.on my fitness pal which syncs with the Fitbit app. When I go over my calorie limit, I dont beat myself up, I just get right back on track with the ne meal. I had to laugh at a news spot on tv a couple weeks back that proved wearing an activity band did not promote weight lossOf course wearing it doesnt,.you have to put the tool to work!;I have lost 12lbs however wish to get it back. Do I have to cut back some?Wish to return to 140lbs.;It is well known fact that food is the key of our overall health whether it is our mental health or physical health. I think ;with diet is the best way to keep our-self healthy. I have also read ;tips over your site which seems very interesting and easy to do.

What is important is that their RMR is still approx 500 kcal/day lower than predicted requirements 6 years later. This level is way below the reduced RMR caused by weight loss. Caloric reduction diets cause more problems than they solve because the body over-adapt. Intermittent-fasting diets make more sense because the body can never adapt to starvation conditions so the RMR doesnt drop more than predicted. Read The Obesity Code by Dr. Jason Fung he sites numerous studies of the long-term failure of calorie reduction diets and states that intermittent-fasting diets dont cause the same drastic drops in RMR, only RMR reductions that are in-line with weight loss. 6 years ago I lost 40 pounds by calorie-reduction and had my RMR drop way below what it should have been while e a resting pulse of 40-45. I intentionally slowly regained the 40 pounds and 6 months ago eliminated simple carbs and alcohol and subsequently lost 40 pounds without affecting my RMR more than predicted by weight loss. I have recently started a intermittent fasting diet so well see if Dr Fung is right.; ; ; Please note: Comments are moderated and may not appear immediately after submission. ;Your email address will not be published.

As we increasingly rely on these devices, the more capabilities vendors will need to provide. Many offer solutions that allow us to do more with our smartphones and tablets than we could imagine, including printing. With the , Xerox meets the mobile printing needs of our enterprise customers looking for a secure and manageable solution without the need to download drivers, tools or software. But a different approach was required for our customers who use desktop and line who need a simple, individual solution they could deploy and manage on their own. Image Credit: Xerox So formed a small team of software engineers to investigate how to support this currently unmet requirement. The project culminated in , a mobile app that allows our customers to print from their iOS and Android-based smartphones and tablets to the default printer installed on your computer, regardless of vendor, technology, or connection type. The solution is free, and is designed to be installed and managed by the customers themselves no IT support required. This project is a fantastic way to gather feedback from our SMB customers as we seek to learn more about how customers are printing with their smartphones and tablets. Their input will help guide our work in the future and ensure we are adding the features our customers really want. While it may lack in the kinds of security features that enterprise office environments require, for some it may be a good fit in a couple different scenarios: - The PrintBack app is one the most useful apps I have ever owned.

You would have only one paper supplier. Just one press supplier. No choice of transport, power or consumables suppliers. That is bad news for you as a buyer. But for the seller it great! Or is it? For one thing, it fosters a culture of continuous improvement. You are forced to get better at what you do in order to keep up with or stay ahead of your competitors. This means you stay relevant to your customers. They continue to see a need for your services. Would people use as much print today if you were still printing on paper and presses using technology from 20 years ago or more?! The other advantage of competition is that it shows you are in a marketplace that is still relevant. Fortunately, that is still definitely the case for print. It is worth giving this careful consideration. A few years ago it used to be other printing companies in your neighborhood. These days, location is less of an issue. Your competitor is just as likely to be an internet-based company. , not all companies look the same. Which are the ones that are similar to you? Which ones offer the same products and services to the same type of customer that you deal with? These are the ones that you should be keeping an eye on. Your competitors may not even be printing companies. Who else is after the same budgets of your customers? Are you in the business of selling direct mail? Then your competitors are just as likely to be e-mail marketing companies. Here are just some of the things that you should know about your competitors: Having the right knowledge about your competitors will challenge you and help you to develop. You should be reviewing what other companies are doing regularly. Do you have a monthly meeting set aside for this? It all very well having the desire to review what your competition is doing.

The research polled 267 Citrix and ; partners across Northern Europe, including responses from partners in the UK and Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. The research e the state of play in the channel industry, to gain better understanding of growth opportunities and focus areas this year.; some turbulent market conditions and macro-economic factors, eighty-eight per cent of partners e 2017 revenues to grow compared with last year. Eighty-four per cent forecast profit growth in the same period as well. Nearly one in three partners (31%) have even predicted over 20% revenue growth of year-on-year, with a further fifth (21%) believing profit margins will reach similar heights.;Most interestingly, and pertinent to our own cloud-first strategy: the channel has projected a strong shift to cloud revenues this year, with the majority of partners (71%) e to see this account for at least 10% of revenues. This is compared with 60% of partners who stated cloud revenues drove under 10% of earnings last year. Further, there is e that cloud revenue is likely to double: 38% of partners stated cloud would account for over 20% of business in 2017 compared to only 17% of partners in 2016.;The delivery of cloud or hosted cloud services and reselling third-party or hosted cloud services were also both earmarked as important business drivers in 2017 by nearly half of channel partners (48% and 42%, respectively). While nearly two in three partners (59%) also acknowledged reselling on-premises hardware and software as a remaining driver of growth, the IT industry appears to be reaching a watershed moment for the sale of cloud services.;New technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and the Internet of Things (IoT) are disrupting industries across a multitude of sectors, yet channel partners are divided on how much theyre set to drive revenue growth for 2017. For e, just over half (51%) of partners cited the IoT as important for driving revenues, with 37% stating it wont be important and over one in ten (12%) admitting they wont sell it at all this year.;Alongside this, nearly one in three (30%) partners believe Big Data revenue will grow by less than 10%, yet cloud application revenue and digital transformation projects are both forecast to grow in revenue by over 20% (according to 30% and 26% of partners, respectively).;The vast majority (92%) of channel partners e their customers to increase their cyber-security spends in 2017, cloud growth marked as the second largest driver of spending behind cyber-crime. Increased mobility and changing governance and regulation were also cited as the key drivers.;Its clear that the IT industry is facing one of the largest periods of change since its inception, with new and innovative technologies disrupting the bigger players and driving increased customer churn. Despite this challenge, channel partners are forecasting a year of significant growth, with the cloud earmarked as a driver of such change.;The message is clear when it comes to the delivery of cloud services. The time for action is now, and only by working with the right vendors can partners truly capitalise on this opportunity. The proof is very much in the data, and our own channel partners are seeing a demand for cloud from their customers meaning we really are about to enter the cloud-era.;Justin Sutton-Parker is Citrix Director for Partners Northern Europe roles include Hewlett Packard as Managing Chief Technologist, Country Leader for Cloud Service Providers, Global Alliances Director, Microsoft Alliance Director, and Public Sector manager.

By its name, it sounds like a show that focuses on consumer-based electronics which most find interesting on a personal basis. But, you many wonder: What does CES offer for B-to-B marketers? Why would marketers go to an electronics show, when attending means fighting 160,000 other attendees, trying to see 3,500 e and tromping around a space that is 35 football fields in size to see the latest in technology-driven innovation? The power of CES is in showcasing how emerging technology will be applied to our daily lives how we live, work, and (most important to marketers) communicate. Marketing, media, advertising and communications are massively impacted by technology. CES provides valuable insight into what is happening today, and more importantly, where it is all going tomorrow. @Xero advertising chief e what #CES2015 meant to business-to-business #B2B #marketers. http:/ctt.ec/zfn+ The overarching takeaway from CES is technology that is enabling everything and everyone to be and . How this is materializing and impacting people lives at work, at home and even in our cars, provides marketers with new ways for engaging with their audience, as well as for creating engaging content for that audience. Furthermore, these new channels provide data streams that can help marketers understand their audiences better, and to communicate the right message, at the right time, to the right person. The importance of CES for marketers is underscored by this year launch of C Space a partnership between the Association of National Advertisers and the Consumer Electronics Association. C Space is a designated area specific to marketers, creative communicators, branding e, agencies, and publishers. While C Space received a from me, it was the first year, so I have no doubt it will grow and be a much stronger presence in the future. Also noteworthy is how well attended CES was by the agency community. Our own global media agency, MEC, orchestrated a client e that provided thought leadership to CES by hosting private presentation sessions. One such session was an interview between MEC Global CEO Charles Courtier, and WPP Group Chairman Sir Martin Sorrell. Sorrell, 2015 will be another year of it out. MEC also curated guided tours of the show floor which is the ONLY way to make sense of the CES mayhem. Y&R Global CEO David Sable was also in attendance and hosted a small luncheon with David Shing, AOL Digital Prophet, shared fascinating insights and perspective on CES. Technology that debuted at #CES2015 will create new channels for #B2B #marketers to engage their audiences,via @bbasney http:/ctt.ec/KCvhI+ While CES is a hotbed of innovation candy, be warned: You have to think out of the box a bit because the opportunity for marketers may not be what was actually featured at the show. For e, from CES 2014, a virtual reality gamification technology called Oculus Rift was showcased. On its face, it had no applicability to marketers. But, with a little creative thinking it was applied successfully by GE, which used it to show their seabed factories used for deep sea oil and natural gas fields. These areas are rarely visited by humans in reality, but easily visited via virtual reality. On dry land, Marriott created virtual hotel e for some of their most e and remote destination properties. The only thing missing was the cool tropical breeze and the smell of jasmine. Considering both media and brand content, my notes from #CES2015 included: Driverless cars? 360 degree cams? @Xero ad chief @bbasney shares her 7 takeaways from #CES2015. http:/ctt.ec/a5D0n+ #B2B #marketers So to my marketing colleagues: Don underestimate the relevance of CES for creativity, content and communications. And maybe we can lobby CES to do a bit of rebranding: I vote for the Engagement Show. do you think? [] The full article can be found here. [] I watched the brief video on the link you shared.

Drag racing fans love the popular All-Ford series, which brings out the best heads-up, Open Comp and bracket racers who vie for a national championship. NMRA events are also great because they host a huge car show, manufacturer midway and swap meet where you can find great deals on rare and unique Ford parts. NMRA is also known for its True Street category, where street-legal Fords complete a 30-mile drive before assaulting the drag strip with the required three back-to-back-to-back passes to determine who has the quickest road-going Ford in the region. Fans at Maple Grove also saw the Micro Strategies Stock/Super Stock Showdown, which featured NHRA and IHRA-legal Ford machines including 8-second Cobra Jets, 5.0 Fo Mustangs and plenty of old-school muscle. Located near Reading, PA, Maple Grove Raceway opened in 1962 and is one of the most scenic tracks you find. It set in the beautiful hills of Berks County with plenty of trees and great places to pit and watch racing. Unfortunately, Mother Nature had different plans for the 17 Annual Ford Motorsport Nationals. Friday was canceled due to rain, but racers got on track Saturday and blasted to quick elapsed times. And despite the sketchy weather, there were many upsides to the Motorsport Nationals. We saw the return of multi-time champ Charlie Booze Jr. to NMRA action. Booze was behind the wheel of a gold Mustang LX called Lust that he campaigning in G-Force Racing Transmission Coyote Stock. Booze Brothers Racing set up the 1986 LX owned by Justin Fogelsonger that was formerly a Factory Stock car, but is now running in Coyote Stock. Booze was able to click off an impressive 10.49 at 127 mph, good enough to secure 9 place in the 17-car field. Meanwhile, the top spot was held by Jacob Lamb, who ran 10.22/128.16 mph with his wheelstanding Coupe. What most impressive is that all Coyote Stock cars feature a Ford Performance sealed 5.0 Coyote crate engine making 435 hp. Fans also saw wild action in VP Racing Street Outlaw. Street Outlaw machines are the most powerful in the NMRA and blister the track, running eight-mile times in the 4s at 160-plus mph. Manny Buginga took the top spot in the 10-car field with a 4.51 at 164 mph. Hot on his heels was Brian Devilbliss, Michael Carvolho and Charlie Cooper. Edelbrock Renegade is the quickest quarter-mile class in the NMRA and Frank Varela took advantage of the track with his blue LX, clocking a pole-setting 7.54 at 180 mph. Like Street Outlaw, Renegade had 10 cars and the top six ran a 7-second elapsed time. Procharger Coyote Modified is another mind-bending class, which as been owned as of late by the Got To Have It Green Cobra Jet of John Kauderer. Kauderer ran a sold 7.82 at 171 mph to qualify number one he was followed closely by the 2014 Peoples-backed Cobra Jet of Tommy Annunziata (7.901/174.55) and the Boss 302 of Jeff Polivka who ran 7.905 at 174.77 mph. Eleven cars turned up for Richmond Gear Factory Stock, where a mix of Windsor and Coyote-powered Fords do battle. Mike Bowen drove his Coyote-powered 5.0 to the pole with a 10.76 at 122.16 mph. He was chased closely by Matt Amrine (10.790/123) and Sondra Leslie who clicked off a 10.790/121-mph pass with her big wheelie Strange Engineering-backed LX. Factory Stock had 8 cars running between 10.76 and 10.99 with a mix of power plants and body styles. Saturday concluded with qualifying in E Modular Muscle, Aerospace Open Comp, Roush Super Stang, Detroit Locker Truck and Race Pages Ford Muscle, plus there was one round of eliminations in the Micro Strategies Stock/Super Stock Showdown. NMRA fields were set for Sunday eliminations, and racers warmed up in the crisp air, while the track crew prepped the surface for competition. Unfortunately, as drivers were suiting up to start, the weather turned ugly. A light mist progressed to a full rain shower that persisted for 30-40 minutes. Despite their best effort, track officials and the NMRA determined it would be impossible to dry the track and provide a safe, competitive racing surface. So with that, the event was sadly cancelled and it was announced that the points-earning classes would be contested at the NMRA Super Nationals to be held June 8-11 at National Trail Raceway in Hebron, Ohio.'",ford,3,19,142.194,0.3,-0.65,n,y,n,n,n,-0.0044982539,0.0076246797,-0.0091352347,-0.0432332571,-0.0073317368,4426,263,5.9421599638,65.96,y,n,y,y,n,2,5,3,1,4

Impossible or just elusive, zero downtime is the dream for printers. It the dream because the opposite is a nightmare of idle machines that no printer wants to see haunting their plant floor. The more jobs a machine processes, the quicker it pays for itself. The trouble is, cost pressures are squeezing cents and dollars from margins, so the you invested in needs to work harder to pull its weight. Which means the price of an hour downtime is higher than ever. So how do you push productivity to eleven? Here are some tips for the road to zero downtime. Before we start the journey to our zero downtime dream, we need to kick the tires on the hardware that going to get us there. Ma uptime is all about the friction out of . But boosting productivity isn necessarily a good thing. Bill Gates famously mapped out the two roads that automation can take your business down: the road from good to better, and the road from bad to worse. He said: first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency. Make the most of the equipment you have, and play to its strengths. Scale up your most efficient, lucrative activities and try to wean yourself off the rest. If you spot gaps in your infrastructure that are holding you back, invest in the technology that will open up that opportunity if the returns will justify the investment. Innovation is no good if the result is clunky processes and half-speed workflows. When printing doesn flow, it fails. And as you push towards capacity, the process pitfalls that lie just beneath the surface get bigger and bigger. To stop the cracks from appearing in your workflows, you need to do two things well: automate and simplify. Make it easy on your customers and yourself. Use web-to-print portals so customers can easily order prints to their preferred specifications again and again. Simplify pre-press processes wherever touches can be removed and automate decision-making using smart workflows and conditional logic. Look at the end-to-end process instead of a series of segments: super-slick silos are still silos, and stitching together processes leaves gaps at the seams. (For more on this, you might like our recent eBook: .) Since reliability is paramount, work redundancy into your flow so important jobs can be moved to a backup printer if needed. This may seem like a downtime catch-22, where working to capacity requires capacity, but no one said dreams were easy to nail down! Read our post on so you can stay out of them. You can fill the gaps in your workflows if you don know they e. Visibility is everything, so make sure everyone who needs it has access to reporting dashboards and other relevant metrics. Set up automatic alerts that immediately notify the right people when something goes wrong, not further down the line when it causes a bottleneck. Keep your team in the loop so they can monitor job status reports and identify any issues quickly. Customers need clear visibility of their order too, so keep them up to date with email notifications as part of your service. They be happier, and your staff won be bogged down on the phones answering customer queries. Before you try to supercharge your operation, take time to see where the efficiencies and inefficiencies lie. your sweet spot, whether that a , like custom variable or wide format, or a , like small companies in specific verticals that you can really partner with to cover all their print needs. If you on the then look for opportunities to process more value-add jobs and cross-media services. This will help to solidify your status as a strategic partner for the long term. Holy Grail or pipe dream, zero downtime represents a very real ambition to get the most out of your production printing equipment.

This level of #innovation doesn happen overnight. http:/ctt.ec/bZK4b+ via @ The Staples self-serve kiosk is a custom-built device for Staples in-store customers and is unlike anything else on the market. It offers the printing capabilities of the Xerox WorkCentre 7800 Series Multifunction Printer (MFP) and a new Android-based, easy-to-use interface that runs on a standard tablet attached to the MFP. Payment, usage and receipt functionality works seamlessly at the device and also includes the option to scan in coupons or a Staples customer loyalty card during a transaction. This level of innovation doesn happen overnight. In fact, it took nearly two years to bring this device to market. But through the persistence of committed partners with a shared vision we created a breakthrough product that helps customers be more productive. Countless setbacks, surprises and disappointments make innovation difficult but also rewarding. Each partner brought a unique passion to development that helped to overcome every obstacle and bring an industry-defining product to market. In August, nearly 3,000 devices were placed in Staples stores across the country, and although the new self-service fleet is less than three months old, Staples is already seeing a positive response from customers and associates. Jose Bernal, Vice President of Production and Operations for Staples said, growth of traditional services like printing and copying has e our e and new services like scanning and emailing are growing at a surprising clip. The development team recently received the Staples Innovation Award at the annual Staples Supplier Summit. The Innovation Award is given to projects that are breakthrough technologies that significantly improve Staples workflows and the customer e. The development team was awarded the honor for their unlimited commitment to the successful e of a bold vision. The Staples self-serve kiosk was a labor of love and we proud of what we have built together. If partnerships are an evolution, innovation is a journey that we are honored to walk with Staples and EFI. Congratulations on the innovation award Xerox ! On behalf of EFI, it was great to work with Xerox and Staples on this project. _Toby Vice President, EFI On behalf of Xerox, thank you Toby and the entire EFI team for your partnership in delivering this innovative solution to Staples and its customers.

Bush got the jump on a restart following a caution flag with 6 laps to go that temporarily erased a 2.5-second lead for Busch over Keselowski and 19-second lead over Logano. The restart was just what Logano needed to increase his position by one spot after proving better on the short-run than his teammate.

The Mid-Ohio Challenge begins at 3:30 PM on NBCSN. 2nd Joey Logano Brad Keselowski Kevin Harvick Cole Custer Ryan Reed Casey Mears fun. Dang, I wish it was for the win and not for second. I had such a good short run car, just in the wrong position to start that last run. I feel like if I was second I could have won the race. I just had a really good short run car. Our long run speed was off a bit and that when the 18 and 22 would drive by us and we were a third-place car on the long run but probably a winning car on the short run. By time I cleared the 22 the 18 was gone. If we had another four or five laps (he would have drove off again). I needed a caution. course. Anytime you can run these things and race up there for the win and stuff like that it feels like the old days again. It a nice little confidence builder for me, for our pit crew, for everybody to be up there. I got a good car for tomorrow that we can do something similar with. Just a good day overall to keep the momentum going. a little bit everywhere. The Toyota's had the Fords and Chevy out-classed so bad on horsepower and downforce that they can spin out on their own and still win the race. That just goes to show you how big a difference there is. I gave it all I had. Joey and I were racing for best in class and he did a good job. It was a heck of a race there at the end. was an eventful day for sure. We were just way, way, way too loose to start the day. We were able to get it better but restarts weren better for us. The longer we ran the better we were. We were just lacking a lot of rear grip out there today and that was our undoing. started out loose and got tighter as the run went but when we were by ourselves we passed a lot of cars and had top-5 lap times. We just got set back a little there. We were going to have a pretty good day but had a terrible restart there at the end. That was one of my worst ones, probably ever. That is what cost us the most. The very end at that restart. were a third place car on the long run and maybe a first place car for the first two laps of every run. It just depended on what type of race we had. We had some issues on pit road with a lugnut getting stuck behind a wheel and lost a lot of track position. Once we got to third I went into cruise control to save my stuff and hope for a late-race restart and boom, we had one. I thought it was my chance but just couldn accelerate as good as Kyle (Busch) and wasn able to stay with him. Brad (Keselowski) and I had a fun battle to the end. By the time I got by Brad the 18 was just too far in front of me. It was a little too late. Maybe one more restart and one of those green-white-checkered things would have been nice. Overall, to start on the pole and be the runner-up doesn always feel good but we did learn some things for tomorrow. was an interesting day. For us to get the first stage win and a bonus point for the owners points and playoffs was good. Just kind of threw all I had at it and the Toyota were just way faster than everybody. It was all I could do to just try to keep up. I was pretty happy. We might not have won the race but we were racing for first in class there with Joey and that was fun. All in all a fun day here at Watkins Glen. I enjoy running this race. I really like this track. Wish we could have won it but I don think that was possible with the discrepancy in cars. hope so. I think it is up in the air after the news came down this last week. I don really know what is going to happen and what races we will pick. We will have to be a little more picky about the races we choose to run because we don have that many we can run. don know. I might just go run some local tracks ne year where people want me to run. didn have any input but I don feel bad about it. I think it is a decent rule. There is nothing that will make everyone happy and we will go through the balancing act of having this set of rules and inevitable we will have a race where we have eight green-white-checkers maybe a year or five years from now and then the team owners will get upset and we will go backwards a little bit. The tug and pull and ebb and flow of automobile racing. That is where the ebbs and flows are now and it isn really worth a lot of energy to fight it.

CEO, TheSelfEmployed.com What would you do if it was your job to tediously copy by hand, for hours on end, day after day, intricate, confusing, detailed patent applications? Get a new job, right? That might be true for most of us, but it wasn true for Chester Carlson. Instead of looking for a better gig, Carlson invented a better way, namely, the process that led to the Xerox copier. I first wrote about Carlson and his amazing journey and invention in my book, . Frustrated by his day job, Carlson went home every night to his place in the Astoria apartment building in [Queens] to study photography, the physics of light, paper, and printing. It took three long years, but in his makeshift Astoria lab Carlson finally perfected what he called and on October 22, 1938, he successfully created a blurry yet legible copy that read, now sits in the Smithsonian. What Carlson created that day was a lot more than a new way to save some time. In the end, the Xerox machine begat nothing less than a workplace revolution that continues to this day. As I am often wont to say, this is the greatest time ever to run a small business, and the main reason is technology. These days, companies like Xerox are creating a plethora of tools that enable small business to look as big as their biggest competitors. Indeed, it looks to me like Xerox has done it again, with their largest launch of new products ever occurring on March 29. Two keys to more than a century of innovation at @Xerox. https:/ctt.ec/J07N0+ pic.twitter.com/N4jijrCrwX But before I get to that, what I want to share first is an observation that I hope resonates with my small business brothers and sisters, namely that when Chester Carlson had his big idea, he essentially was a gig worker, not unlike you maybe. Even so, it took almost a decade before his nascent technology became a viable product, and that was only after having been turned down by IBM and a host of other big companies. But Chester Carlson had two things going for him that allowed him to persevere, things you should keep in mind if you too are looking to innovate in your business. . This is where innovation starts. One thing I learned by studying and interviewing some of the great inventors and innovators of the 20 century was that the sweet spot of innovation occurs when a great idea meets a market need. Find that, and you will hit a homerun. Xerox latest (all 29 of them!) are a perfect e. As the folks from Xerox told me, time to stop thinking about printers as standalone, task-specific workhorses, and start demanding more up-to-date, useful useable. In order to do that, they re-thought the printer and its place at the office. What you will be finding in your office in the near future are beyond multifunction devices; they are smart workplace assistants that will be the hub of your connected office, delivering an , providing , and critically, . The interface will look much like your phone or tablet, interactive and with downloadable apps of your choice intended to allow you to do a variety of tasks. As Xerox told me, you will be able to and tap your way through on a large, colorful, tablet-like screen. How cool is that? , he needed partners. In his case, he eventually teamed up with a man named Joe Wilson who ran a photography business called Haloid. Combining Wilson business sense with Carlson inventive genius is what it took to build Xerox (a name, by the way, created when Wilson hired a linguistics professor to help name the technology. They combined two Greek words, Xeros and Graphos to create Xerography, literally, writing.) The spirit of partnership is alive and well at Xerox today. With the launch of the latest ConnectKey products, Xerox channel partners the businesses that you work directly with and purchase equipment from for your small business, can innovate themselves. They can use the Xerox App Gallery to build to meet the specific needs of small business owners.

b'http://blogs.zebra.com/what-is-the-meaning-of-enterprise-class-wi-fi',4,21,122.136,1,159.253,4,8,8,586,40,3,"b"" ; May 6, 2015 at 6:12 AM ;With the ever growing adoption of mobility (i.e. smartphones, tablets etc.) and the desire for people to be connected to the internet regardless of their location (at home, at school or work etc.) Wi-Fi has quickly become the favorite type of network connection. Although wireless wide area networks such as 3G or 4G are now available in most urban areas, Wi-Fi is still preferred in most cases due to wide support of all sort of devices and the fact that you can get free connection now in most public places, including bars/restaurants, airports, hotels, city centers, stadium etc. More importantly, most people now enjoy Wi-Fi at home and e the same e when they travel, leisure, work etc. It's fair to say that Wi-Fi has grown from being a niche technology used by companies in warehouses and other business environments to a commodity technology (available to almost everyone). ; So if Wi-Fi has now become commodity, does this mean that the same Wi-Fi technology that we use at home can be used in business environments as well? Not e. Even though we have standards for Wi-Fi products, which guarantee that an Access Point from vendor X works with a tablet from vendor Y, there are some important differences between products that are designed for personal use (or SOHO, Small Office / Home Office) and Enterprise Class solutions. While most people can imagine that a Wi-Fi network in a large hospital, university or retailer with hundreds of stores will have other requirements than the Wi-Fi you have at home, the differences may be less obvious for a Small or Medium Business (SMB). Especially when looking at the price of your little home router or AP, it may look attractive to buy the same products for your business. After all, it works at home, so why wouldn't it work at the office. Good question. Well, the answer is that at work (regardless the size of your business) you probably need an Enterprise Class solution. So then tell me what 'Enterprise Class' means, I hear you think. Basically it means that the solution is 'fit' for use in a professional business environment which then means it has specific features and options which supports your business better than a home or SOHO product. Let's take a look at some of these specific features and options. ; - Support for mobility:; In many business environments, Wi-Fi users are often not tied to a desk and roam between different parts of the building as they are working and communicating. If we take an average coverage size of a Wi-Fi AP of approx. 2000 sq meters (of course it depends on multiple factors but lets take an average), multiple APs are needed to coverage a larger building, multiple floors, outdoor areas etc. As users roam from AP to another and their connection is being handed over, the communication should not drop or e delays, as this will result in a drop in their applications. Even with WPA2 Enterprise security (user is authenticated) this handover should be seamless. Especially with real time applications, such as VoIP or video, support for mobility and fast roaming is very important. ; - Security:; Everybody now understands that Wi-Fi networks should be well secured in order not to risk having information stolen that is transmitted through the air, or getting uninvited guests on your network. Most APs (even SOHO product) now support different encryption options and maybe offer user authentication too. Is this enough? It is probably for your home installation, but in a business environment again, you probably have some additional concerns. First of all, as you may use a mi of different client devices, its important to be able to support different security options simultaneously. For e you may want to use WPA2 encryption on handheld terminals but demand some form of authentication on laptops (as they access more sensitive data). Secondly, just securing your data and devices may not be enough. Having some form of Intrusion Detection provides you with information when someone actually tries to access your network unauthorized or compromise your data so measures can be taken. ; - Guest Access:; Even though the primary reason for deploying a Wi-Fi network in your business may be to provide access for your own employees, it may be a good idea to share a piece of the wireless bandwidth with your visitors and guests. Again, here it's important to guarantee the security, after all you want to know who's entering your site (both physically as through the network) and separate guest traffic from business traffic. Providing a Captive Portal, where users can register themselves or logon through their social media account helps to reduce the support burden that is typically involved with a guest network (e.g. with generating and providing vouchers, managing temporary user accounts etc). Separating your guest traffic from corporate traffic can be achieved by assigning separate vlans. ; - Configuration and Management:; Topics: ;, ; """,zebra,6,29,184.162,0,-0.5,y,y,n,n,n,0.0013813198,0.0129821307,-0.0121868952,-0.0854804537,-0.029518791,4985,373,7.482447342,40.52,n,n,y,y,y,4,3,5,1,2

If you don choose the correct oil, you could accelerate engine wear and cause a premature failure. The right help with fuel economy and emissions. So, choosing the right oil your vehicle is critical to your durability, efficiency and lifespan. Regardless of type of vehicle you own, buying oil with a on the package.

According to the , viscosity is property of resistance to flow in a fluid or semifluid. Regarding your oil, that a fancy way of saying viscosity a measure of how well the oil flows under different conditions. Motor oil viscosity is represented in numerical values. is designated by motor oil grades, which signify the oil rating from the (SAE). most climates, there are two parts to viscosity numbers. For e, 5W 30. The first number and letter, 5W, is a representation of how well the oil flows in colder weather. The stands for winter. The lower the number, the better the oil flows in colder temperatures. The second number, 30, is the measure of oil flow at operating temperature. The normal operating temperature of most engines, according to , is 195 to 225 degrees Fahrenheit. Similar to the number, the lower the second number, the easier the oil flows at operating temperature. In some areas, there may be only one number, such as 30 or 40. You usually find this in warmer climates where a number would be irrelevant. said, these numbers are very important. They represent the flow characteristics of the oil under a variety of temperature conditions, which is vital to engine operation. Typically, this information can be found right on the oil cap of your. If it isn listed, look the owner manual for your vehicle. Some oil recommendations are based on a chart that shows different temperature ranges where different viscosities can be used. These are not just recommendations. Engineers go to great lengths to determine which oil is best for their engine so it is important to them. Some people might think it OK to put thicker oil into a noisy engine when in fact, this may actually cause more engine damage. The thicker oil can take longer to lubricate the engine during startup. This means that important components are functioning without lubricant, thus increasing wear on those components. I do not recommend the use of thicker oil in an engine for any reason. I prefer to use synthetic oil because it can withstand higher temperatures and doesn have to be changed as often as conventional oil. However, it not always recommended the manufacturer. Some engines require the use of synthetic oil, but most don. Check your owner manual for the specifics on your engine. So, what the difference between conventional oil and synthetic oil? Most synthetic oils actually use an organic oil base. This means both oils share the same organic starting point very few synthetic oils are actually synthetics. It the refinement of that base oil and the additive package that qualifies it as synthetic. Some engines require the use of synthetic oil, but most don. Check your owner manual for the specifics on your engine. I prefer to use synthetic oil because it can withstand higher temperatures and doesn have to be changed as often as conventional oil., as long as you use the correct viscosity and your engine doesn require synthetic oil conventional oil will probably work just fine. So if you on a budget, regular, conventional oil(also called or organic oil), can the job done, in my opinion. If you have a vehicle with more than 60,000 miles on it, you may want to try high-mileage oil. High-mileage oil uses a special additive package that is designed for engines with higher miles. This additive package contains special seal conditioners and other components that help a high-mileage engine run its best.

Romax Marketing out of London, England believes they on to one. Creating apps for their clients which combine content from PDF files they already printing with multimedia audio and video files into apps which are playable on mobile and tablet devices. Greg Cholmondeley, Workflow Practice Director of PODi, interviewed Wes Dowding, Operations and Technology Director, about where they are and where they going. If you think that they onto something, like Greg does, PODi is hosting a webinar with Wes titled on Wednesday, June 22 at 2:00 PM Eastern Time. Here are some e from a preparatory interview with him: : Give me a little background about Romax Marketing today : Romax offers a full range of direct marketing services including design, data services, online marketing, print, web applications, e-publishing, mail fulfilment and other related services. Our large modern warehouse, office and production units covering 15,000 square feet are located in Greenwich, London close to the 02. : How did you get here? : We began back in 1997 as a direct mailer back primarily serving the arts with clients like the National Theatre and the Southbank Centre but have really evolved to being a true solutions provider. That evolution changed our perspectives, approach and pushed us into e our services and media channels. : That can be a tough transition. What was involved in your services and media channels? : Well, yes it was quite a challenge. To really become a solutions provider, we needed to add email, SMS and web services along with printing and mailing. We had to learn things like how to program HTML and how email clients work. And we had to change our clients opinions of what we offered. It was a sizeable investment in terms of staff, training and technology to get here. : And, now you adding yet another service to create apps for your clients. : Yes, but this is quite different. We used the from Xerox to build something we branded Publicus to help our clients deliver their content via apps for mobile and tablet devices. Most of the technical work is done by the platform so there wasn a huge training cost and the technology investment was so low that it was a no brainer. : And this takes the same PDF files they send you for printing and makes them accessible on mobile devices, right? : Yes, but it does a lot more than that. People don want to read PDF files on their phones. They want apps that scroll and flow and rotate. They want to be able to click video links to see performance clips, or to hear interviews. This isn just putting files online. : And did you start out with a client asking for this or is this all driven from your end? : No, this wasn built to solve an e customer problem. We saw the technology, recognized the potential, and felt that the investment risk was minimal. Of course, now we do have a client, the London Broncos rugby team. They very e about where we can take them with this and I show you where we are with this project on our webinar. : That sounds like a cue to wrap up this interview. Is there anything else you like to add? : You right, we do have a lot to do. We really e about the direction this could take our company and so are our clients. It is a slow-burn type of process because these are marketing activities which are new ideas for our clients as well and don yet have funding but they will!

Racers came from as far as Vermont, New York, and California to compete on the famous quarter-mile that was ultra-grippy and provided the fast Fords with plenty of wheelstanding traction. NMCA provided a special Cobra Jet pit area that was filled with every variety of late-model CJ, from the 2008 to the current 2016 Shootout model. The showdown was presented by Diversified Products Marketing and featured two formats of racing with a combined purse over $3,000. The main class was run Open Comp-style on a .500 Sportsman tree. A second Challenge class was created to reward the most consistent drivers. Cobra Jet Central revolved around Watson Racing rig, and giant tent area. Ford Performance and Watson also had the tent setup for racers and enthusiasts who wanted to get out of the sun, grab a bite to eat and talk about hot Fords. In addition, Cobra Jet drivers could also participate in the NMCA Holley EFI Factory Super Car Showdown, a heads-up category for Cobra Jet, Chevrolet COPO Camaros and the Dodge Drag Pak Challenger. Chuck Watson Sr. set the early pace in qualifying, but ultimately ended up in the second slot after running 8.11 at 165 mph. This was the quickest NMCA-legal Cobra Jet pass to date. Right on Watson heels was Carl Tasca in his 2016 CJ at 8.120/166 mph. Diversified Products Marketing CJ Shootout qualifying was led by Paul Roderick and his 2013 CJ. Qualifying was based on reaction time and Roderick was nearly perfect with a .004 light. Getting the top spot wasn easy, as Charley Downing and Ricky Pennington were right there with .009 and .010 bulbs respectively. Roderick rolled into eliminations and he faced the ever-tough John Calvert in the opening round. Calvert had the better light but he ran into problems, opening the door for Roderick who snuck past for the win. In other First-round action Anthony Bongiovanni beat Ed Brown, Matt Bell defeated Steve Trombley, Tom Brown got past Darrell Dietz and Rick Rodgers took out Chuck Watson II in a close battle. In Round two Roderick was spot on clicking off a 9.06 to hold off the hard-charging Bongiovanni, Rodgers beat a redlighting Brown and Bell took the bye run. In semi-final action, Rodgers was awarded the bye, while Roderick and Bell squared off. Bell got the jump by .007 on the tree, but Roderick got around for the win. That set up the Roderick vs. Rodgers final. Roderick was on a rail, while Rodgers was struggling to keep the front end on the ground. Earlier in the event the Michigan runner blasted off a pair of power wheelstands, the second doing damage to the 2014 CJ. Rodgers was able to fix the all-white Ford and get it running in the 8s. Roderick went green, nailing a .066 light and Rodgers tree dropped moments later. The Westernport, MD driver was a touch slower with a .089 light, but the race was on and the silver and white CJs marched down track. As they approached the stripe, Roderick kept his silver CJ out front crossing the finish line first by a tight margin, running 9.07 to Rodger 8.99. Roderick was elated after scoring a wire-to-wire win. is just awesome he stated, as he shared the win with his family, including his grandkids, who took part in the winner circle celebration. is an enjoyable event, the NMCA and Ford Performance does a great job supporting the Ford Cobra Jet racers and it so much fun to come out and race. I just happy that everything went my way. I was able to get a good light in qualifying and then to go rounds and win, this is really amazing and I have to thank everyone for helping. Ford Performance and the NMCA presented a second race within a race called the Factory Cobra Jet Challenge. This format was designed to reward consistency and a tight racing ET average. An average of the runs were calculated and the winner was the driver with the quickest average. John Calvert of Lancaster, California was the winner after he produced a slew of low 9 second passes with his familiar 2014 CJ. Ultimately, fans saw a multitude of naturally aspirated and supercharged Ford Cobra Jet race cars, including the quickest and fastest CJ Mustang passes of all time. Carl Tasca was the top-finishing Ford driver in the NMCA classes with a runner-up in the Holley EFI Factory Supercar Showdown. Both Watson Sr. and Tasca put on a great show in qualifying and eliminations and Anthony Bongiovanni has top speed of the meet after he ran 8.20 at 167.68 mph with his Resource1-backed 2016 CJ.

While the frequency of oil changes can vary, depending on the used and the motorcycle manufacturer recommendations, a reasonable estimate is between 3,000 and 6,000 miles, according to . To help you change your oil properly, enthusiast Bochnak offers his tips for doing it right. Watch more videos by Matt at , and on . Hey what up everyone, it Matt from HowToMotorcycleRepair.com. In today video, I want to show you how to do an oil change on your motorcycle. Changing your motorcycle oil can be a simple DIY task that will generally take you about an hour to complete. Now before we get right into the video, I do want to mention that if you are unsure or uncomfortable with any of these procedures mentioned in this video, please seek professional help. Now if you are going to tackle this yourself, let talk about some of the tools and materials that you will need for this project. The first thing is to look in the owner or service manual for the type and amount of oil needed to do an oil change. Make sure to buy the oil, oil filter and tools in advance from a motorcycle parts shop or dealer. Ne, let talk about the tools and items you will need: a drain pan, oil filter pliers or cup wrench, plenty of rags, degreaser and a ratchet with socket or wrench. Remember to wear safety glasses and gloves during this project. It would be best to take your motorcycle for a short ride to warm up the engine and oil, so it can drain out faster. Make sure to allow some time for the e to cool for 15 minutes, as it will be the hottest part of the motorcycle. Place the drain pan under the motorcycle and remove the drain plug. You can also remove the oil fill cap to help the oil drain out faster. Let the oil drain for 5 to 10 minutes. Reinstall the drain plug and tighten to the specification listed in your service manual. Then, wipe up any spilled oil with a rag. Make sure to place any oily rags in an airtight container before disposing of them properly. Ne, place the drain pan under the oil filter. Loosen the oil filter with pliers or a filter cup wrench. Once the filter is loose, allow some of the oil to drain out, before removing the filter. Make sure that the oil filter gasket is still on the filter before placing it in the oil pan. Wipe the gasket surface on the engine block with a clean rag. Before installing the new oil filter, pour about 4 ounces of new oil into the filter. This will help the engine achieve oil pressure sooner and minimize how long the oil light stays on. Apply a small amount of oil to the gasket surface. Go ahead and twist on the new oil filter. Once the gasket meets the engine block, turn the filter another three-quarter to 1 turn to fully tighten. Clean any oil up with a degreaser and a rag. Now it is time to add the new oil. The capacity of this specific bike is about 2.8 quarts, so I going to pour 2 quarts in before firing it up. It is always best to add about 75 percent oil capacity and then gradually add oil rather than overfilling it. Remember to close the oil filler cap before starting the engine. Start it up and let it run for about 10 seconds. Pay attention to the oil light and it should go out after a few seconds. Turn the bike off, and let the oil settle for a few minutes. Now it time to check the oil level. Remove the dipstick and wipe it clean with a rag. Reinsert the clean dipstick, wait a few seconds, and remove it to read the oil level. There will be a MIN and MAX mark on the dipstick, so continue to add oil until the ma oil level mark on dipstick is reached. Finally, log this oil change with the date and mileage for your records. Typically, your owner manual will have some blank pages for recording service and maintenance work. Alright, well I hope you enjoyed this video on how to change your motorcycle oil.

Congrats on the update to the ConnectKey platform so that users can scan and upload documents to cloud-based repositories. I am a big user of cloud based solutions and I am always happy to hear when large corporations take important steps to implement cloud solutions into the workplace. However, I am not too sure about the claim that you can easily from any mobile device. The iPhone just makes it so hard to print from any printer, even the ones that are approved by Apple. How are you overcoming the print from iPhone challenge? Xerox s ConnectKey devices support AirPrint directly. Since AirPrint only works with iOS devices, using it as your primary mobile print solution is best suited when most users have iOS devices and need simple document printing, such as email body te. you mentioned, even with AirPrint printing can sometimes be difficult. iOS devices are limited in what they can process when making a document print ready as they try to convert or render the document into PDF format. When you need print content fidelity for business documents, you need something more than AirPrint. new Mobile Print Cloud addresses the need for print content fidelity. Users can send documents from their mobile devices (iOS and Android) to a service running in the cloud. The service takes their document and converts it into a format that is best suited to the target network printer. can buy credits for job processing similar to the way people buy cell phone minutes.

The press release cited several e of how open data has spurred innovation and product development that ultimately has helped the economy. How do you plan to take advantage of the availability and accessibility of this data? The Direct Marketing Association states the response rate of direct mail is more than 30x higher than that of email. You understand the benefits of direct marketing, but actually doing it and doing it well now that a completely different story! A recent Xerox Thought Leadership Workshop delved into everything-direct marketing. Included was a discussion of psychology based marketing and how to trigger the unconscious minds of your consumers, as well as the art and science of selling direct marketing services. We discuss some of the insight shared in Part I of our recap. Some critics have said that book sales and book readership are dying. Others have said that the future of books is not printed books, but electronic books. The most recent evidence suggests that neither is true. Books are not dying and electronic versions of books are not displacing printed versions of books. In a world enamored with online media, it may surprise you to know that 93 percent of designers utilize print as part of their mix. Gordon Kaye, editor and publisher of Graphic Design USA Magazine, reflects on the myth that is dead and shares insight on why graphic designers and other creative professionals continue to view print as central to their personal and professional lives. The benefits of print are clear and proven, and for the good and great designers, it about knowing how and when to employ these traits to advance a message, a brand, an emotion, an idea, a cause, and a sense of authenticity. See how two print and marketing service providers have found growth by aggregating production volume from small and medium-sized businesses that share industry-specific marketing needs.

The printing industry had e a perfect storm as a result of several major disruptions. These include cyclical changes in our economy, structural changes such as rising postal rates, more work done on local printers and copiers, technology changes, and changes to the business model. Are you feeling the after effects of the storm? What are you doing to create your own recovery? In the ultra-competitive print industry, it is clear that your customers of today and tomorrow have choices. What sets your business apart? Is it your technology, variable data services, or fast turn-around times? After outsourcing ,000 worth of work per month to local digital printers, British printer, KJB, shares their e venturing into digital print with a new Xerox DocuColor 8080, allowing the company to tap into new growth opportunities. Despite the prevalence of electronic devices and mobile technology, print remains a highly effective, revenue-generating tool. 67% of online searches are driven by offline messages, with 39% ending with a purchase. A March 2013 study found print media to be the most trusted medium among consumers. It not a question of print or electronics but rather how to leverage the combination to create a powerful, integrative marketing mix. Join us on April 25, from 2:30-3:00p EST, as Xerox hosts a Google+ Hangout with Graphic Design USA Magazine and Anderson Direct Marketing. We will discuss the enduring power of print, effective combinations of print and digital, and innovations that are making print smarter and more effective. Did you know that CO2 emissions from making a CD are 4 times higher than from printing a 100 page, 4-color annual report? Or that printing is the only medium with a one-time carbon footprint, as all other media requires energy every time they are viewed? Despite these facts, the printing industry is constantly facing challenges regarding its place in messaging, its environmental impact, and its future. Google and Toshiba are just a few of the recent e of industry giants that have publicly made false claims about print. It became clear how critical it was to communicate that printed products are environmentally and socially responsible. Printing Industries of America created the of Print campaign as a response to false claims about print negative impact on the environment and the loss of its effectiveness. One of the best ways to gain an edge in today hyper-competitive graphic communications industry is by defining, pursuing and becoming an e in target markets. That e what enabled Echo Communicate, a Baltimore-based graphic communications company, to become so successful. Focusing on one vertical market gave Echo the opportunity to become an e and led to e growth and higher margins.

A FlyingLab is taking place on board, with which Lufthansa is making the opportunities of digitalisation visible and tangible. This way, we are getting passengers in the mood for the topics of the conference, says Dr Torsten Wingenter, Senior Director of Digital Innovations at Lufthansa. Participants in the Lufthansa flight to Orlando will be welcomed shortly after take-off on 15 May by Dr Jrgen Mller, SAP Chief Innovation Officer via a video clip.;Innovation starts with the e of ideas. We are glad to be able to show you on this flight, together with Lufthansa, what the future of digitalisation looks like, and to give the participants interesting food for thought, says Mller.;The FlyingLab always consists of a conference section and a test section. During the test section of the FlyingLab, passengers can try out the latest technological developments. On the ten-hour flight to Florida, this is the Muse device a technology that measures brain waves, provides feedback and supports meditation. Many passengers find flying stressful, and it is particularly interesting for them to try out the Muse.;At the core of the FlyingLab is the conference section. On board, six speakers give insights into the topics of the future of work (Martin Wezowski, SAP), technical support when travelling (Teemu Arina, author and biohacker) and robots as the future of work (Ingrid Rothe, RSB Partners). The speakers give their talks in front of a camera on the Boeing 747-400. The passengers receive the video livestream and presentation notes via on-board WLAN. This network is independent of FlyNet (internet access) and is installed especially for the FlyingLab. During the talks, the passengers can send written questions to the speakers via their own devices. This not only creates a unique conference atmosphere 10,000 metres above the Atlantic, but also enables a dialogue between passengers and speakers.;There have been three on-board Lufthansa FlyingLabs on the topics of the future of travel and virtual reality to San Jos, to the Fashion Week in New York, and to the digital conference South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin (Te). The topics of the FlyingLabs are coordinated with the respective event at the destination.

Grant Thornton, a services firm specializing in auditing and consulting has 1,600 staff in 22 different offices. Like many organizations, the firm didn pay much attention to its print volume or number of MFPs at first. But being in the financial business, they decided to run an audit on themselves and found that one office alone had about 130 printers, 13 multifunction printers and 13 fax machines, spanning eight brands and 64 models all for 290 employees. It was clear that their unmanaged printing environment was causing problems. First, there was a financial issue, as they were unable to determine printing costs and therefore couldn budget them from year to year. There was also a support issue. Each office maintained their own print fleet, so there were no common print policies or economies. All those devices and their users generated lots of incidents, too, which took time to resolve. For each new version of software or hardware, they had to re-enable a number of devices, a time-consuming e. To get to a better place, this organization decided to adopt centralized and standardized policies to reduce support costs. They wanted a small IT department that could run hardware and software in a centralized way, but managing the output devices wasn to be part of that focus. This was an ideal scenario for a Managed Print Services (MPS) engagement, and Xerox channel partner, , was chosen for the task. Now, proactive management has reduced support demands, as copiers and printers can automatically reorder toner and request technical support. An authentication system provides the print fleet with greater document security. Grant Thornton tackled its resource imbalance by redistributing printers, and they can monitor the fleet performance. Document Store a dedicated person available every day to help with print fleet issues. The company now has a long-term relationship with their MPS vendor, who knows their business inside and out.

b'https://blog.nationwide.com/10-cheap-classic-cars/',5,19,127.372,5,154.899,5,14,22,602,54,9,"b'Like all commodity markets, the classic car market is always evolving. Values go up, values go down, and owners buy, sell, trade, and hold their cars accordingly. But unlike other collectible objects or financial instruments, cars provide a fun way to play with your money actually get to drive and enjoy an old car. Try driving your Facebook stock and see how far you get. I like a bargain as much as the ne guy, and often there are great deals in old cars in the sub-$10,000 realm. Here are 10 classic cars you can buy right now for less than 10 grand that are poised for growth, once everybody else catches on If your goal is ma car for the money, then you have a hard time beating the fourth-generation Electra. Built on the General Motors C-body platform, the Electra offers more interior room than just about anything else on the road. The 455-cid V-8 is nearly bulletproof, and the cars were available with lu options galore. Just six grand buys a car you be proud to own. Everybody needs a good truck. And the F-Series is always an e choice. These si-gen models ride on a trusted platform, and while they mostly no-frills, you can find them with four-wheel drive, a/c, CB radio, sliding rear window, and more. Rust kills them, especially at the front of the bed and the bottom of the B-pillar, so bring your grubby pants and crawl all over the thing to make sure it the clean one you want. These things are so cheap right now: Less than $3,000 gets you a pretty good one, and both sedans and coupes offer up plenty of lu for the price of entry. It cheap to get your own little piece of the of the World. The last of a legend. Cars built on the G-body platform have long gone unloved. Recent interest in hot Buicks like the Grand National and GNX have helped to spark interest in the rest of these models, however, and the El Camino may now be getting its due. Low power and huge saggy doors are still an issue, but few cars on the road are as distinctive. The importance of this car cannot be overstated. It a design that has aged well, and no other car offers up a greater bang-for-buck factor than a 5.0-liter Fox body. Plenty of them have been used and abused, but with so many produced, you can afford to bide your time and be choosy. You still come away with a quick little modern classic. Aftermarket support is incredible, which only adds to this Mustang appeal. Vintage SUVs are one of the best and cheapest ways to enjoy the old-car hobby. These SJ Cherokees shed the faux wood of their Wagoneer cousins but lose none of the brawny appeal. You can get them with either two or four doors, but no matter what you after, a thorough inspection is in order, as quality control issues plagued Jeeps of this era. The 300ZX reinvented the tired Z-car, and it kicked the rest of the world in the face with the relatively cheap performance it offered. Available with or without T-tops, with or without back seats, with or without a turbo, the Z offers so much in such a lovely, lithe package. Reliability is off the charts, and you can still scoot around quickly in the normally-aspirated version, which saves you considerably over the more desirable turbos. Translated, Mustang II means Also, as in, a Mustang, too, you guys. I really am! And it is, in that wretched 1970s malaise kind of way. There is a bright side though: If you want an old Mustang that isn an enormous, ill-handling muscle car, look no further than the Deuce. And they dirt cheap, too. The Newport was Chrysler entry-level model, and it reintroduced a dormant nameplate for Chrysler, after a decade of absence. Several body styles are available, including sedans, convertibles and wagons, but front-end styling distinctive polarizing thanks to the slanted headlight setup. If you like fins with your Chryslers, then look for a , as they vanished after that. There nothing particularly revolutionary about the Chevy II. You might even say they boring. But as staid, cheap, vintage transportation goes, you could do a lot worse than one of these guys. The inline-six is fine, but you have more fun with the 283-cid V-8, which was available for 1964. Tops in terms of collectability are the convertibles, but they also harder to find. Whether you go for one of the affordable classic car models listed above or opt for a pricier investment, you want your vintage car to be protected.

Topics such as artificial intelligence and the future of work are at the focus. The conference takes place on the flight to Orlando/USA to SAPPHIRE NOW, the worlds largest SAP customer event.;This year, SAPPHIRE NOW will begin a day earlier: On flight LH464 to Orlando. A FlyingLab is taking place on board, with which Lufthansa is making the opportunities of digitalisation visible and tangible. This way, we are getting passengers in the mood for the topics of the conference, says Dr Torsten Wingenter, Senior Director of Digital Innovations at Lufthansa. Participants in the Lufthansa flight to Orlando will be welcomed shortly after take-off on 15 May by Dr Jrgen Mller, SAP Chief Innovation Officer via a video clip.;Innovation starts with the e of ideas. We are glad to be able to show you on this flight, together with Lufthansa, what the future of digitalisation looks like, and to give the participants interesting food for thought, says Mller.;The FlyingLab always consists of a conference section and a test section. During the test section of the FlyingLab, passengers can try out the latest technological developments. On the ten-hour flight to Florida, this is the Muse device a technology that measures brain waves, provides feedback and supports meditation. Many passengers find flying stressful, and it is particularly interesting for them to try out the Muse.;At the core of the FlyingLab is the conference section. On board, six speakers give insights into the topics of the future of work (Martin Wezowski, SAP), technical support when travelling (Teemu Arina, author and biohacker) and robots as the future of work (Ingrid Rothe, RSB Partners). The speakers give their talks in front of a camera on the Boeing 747-400. The passengers receive the video livestream and presentation notes via on-board WLAN. This network is independent of FlyNet (internet access) and is installed especially for the FlyingLab. During the talks, the passengers can send written questions to the speakers via their own devices. This not only creates a unique conference atmosphere 10,000 metres above the Atlantic, but also enables a dialogue between passengers and speakers.;There have been three on-board Lufthansa FlyingLabs on the topics of the future of travel and virtual reality to San Jos, to the Fashion Week in New York, and to the digital conference South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin (Te). The topics of the FlyingLabs are coordinated with the respective event at the destination. We thereby offer our passengers a more efficient use of their travel time, and promote dialogue on board, says Dr Wingenter.;With the motto New Heights with Innovation, Lufthansa is hosting the FlyingLab together with SAP, and thus with together with a company for the first time. Together with the SAP Innovation Center Network, Lufthansa Digital Innovations will shape the programme for the inflight conference. The hosts, Dr Torsten Wingenter and Upen Barve, who heads the Department of Customer Strategy & E at the SAP Innovation Center Network, passengers will be welcomed in Frankfurt with a SAPPHIRE NOW gate event.

No too long ago, we didn have the ability to scan and store documents, but when this became available, it was a great asset. Documents could be saved and stored electronically, saving on physical storage and also improving search for archived documents. Enhancing this was an influx of electronic document storage and retrieval services that made life even easier. However, not all businesses have the resources or infrastructure to implement such a system, so they resort (understandably) to a basic storage system, where documents are scanned and filed in a simple file structure. All well and good, however, I regularly see clients scanning a document and sending it to a client or colleague, only for this document to be re-printed at the other end to enable this information to be input into another workflow process. What is simply happening is a picture of this document is being distributed, with the recipient having to understand and manage the information presented to them. All the while this is happening, we are keeping the paper office at a distance. What is needed is for these documents to be , whereby the data contained can be e, amended and introduced into workflows or repositories all the while keeping the document digital. I still sometimes see clients re-typing data from a scanned document into another application. This has a tremendous strain on productivity and also, I believe, on employee satisfaction. To improve productivity and reduce the need for print, there are two simple processes businesses can implement: By utilizing simple, cost-effective software, businesses can easily convert static information coming into their business into intelligent data and improve productivity, while reducing the need for print. enterprises have had amazing success with intelligent document strategies.

To do so, all you need is to have access to the lounge in Terminal 1 at Frankfurt Airport which is open every day from 6:30 to 22:00. Entertainment electronics play an important role in travel. We have selected an impressive innovation from the incredible amount of new products available. Our guests can try these out informally and in a rela atmosphere, says Dr Torsten Wingenter, Senior Director Digital Innovations at Lufthansa. Lufthansa has chosen this time period as the Mobile World Congress starts on 27 February, which attracts many technology lovers.;Lufthansa is therefore making the effects of digitisation both visible and tangible for passengers. This doesnt necessarily have to take place on board: the airline organises events in the air as well as on the ground - from ""FlyingLabs, an open innovations platform on board, to activities on the ground, like here in the lounge. We present our guests with digital innovations right along the travel chain and let them test them. This allows us see what travellers enjoy and what is suitable for our regular operation, says Wingenter.;So far, there has been a FlyingLab on the topic of Virtual Reality en route to Silicon Valley, as well as one on the topic of fashion and technology (""Fashion Tech"") on the way to Fashion Week in New York. On 9 March 2017, the airline has organised the official Lufthansa SXSW FlyingLab flight to the worlds largest digital e in Te. All passengers who have booked a ticket for this day on flight LH440 can take part.;The video glasses, which at first glance look like headphones, can be used anywhere: at home on the sofa, or travelling on a plane. Video content from smartphones, laptops or game consoles is reproduced using a micro-HDMI connection. Thanks to the separate audio input, the user can also use the Avegant Glyph as classic headphones for music or to listen to an audiobook. In the Lufthansa Business Lounge there are ten pairs of glasses with a choice of six videos available. The film selection ranges from rela above the clouds to the profile of a surfing flight attendant and the new long-distance A350 aircraft.;In January 2017, the video glasses were chosen as the Innovation Award Honoree in Las Vegas at the CES technology tradeshow. The special feature of the Glyph is the projection directly on the retina, which is more pleasant for the wearer compared to a screen, says Eric Trabold from Glyph manufacturer Avegant. Eric Trabold is responsible for Sales, Business Development & Marketing at the Silicon Valley start-up. LEDs project the video signal onto two fields which each have two million tiny microscopic mirrors. Lenses focus the light reflection and cast them on the viewers retinas. Wearers of the glasses can adjust the image (+1 to -7 dioptres) to suit them, and interchangeable nose bridges ensure optimum wearing comfort. The Avegant Glyph does not cover the wearers complete field of vision like other VR glasses.

We are glad to be able to show you on this flight, together with Lufthansa, what the future of digitalisation looks like, and to give the participants interesting food for thought, says Mller.;The FlyingLab always consists of a conference section and a test section. During the test section of the FlyingLab, passengers can try out the latest technological developments. On the ten-hour flight to Florida, this is the Muse device a technology that measures brain waves, provides feedback and supports meditation. Many passengers find flying stressful, and it is particularly interesting for them to try out the Muse.;At the core of the FlyingLab is the conference section. On board, six speakers give insights into the topics of the future of work (Martin Wezowski, SAP), technical support when travelling (Teemu Arina, author and biohacker) and robots as the future of work (Ingrid Rothe, RSB Partners). The speakers give their talks in front of a camera on the Boeing 747-400. The passengers receive the video livestream and presentation notes via on-board WLAN. This network is independent of FlyNet (internet access) and is installed especially for the FlyingLab. During the talks, the passengers can send written questions to the speakers via their own devices. This not only creates a unique conference atmosphere 10,000 metres above the Atlantic, but also enables a dialogue between passengers and speakers.;There have been three on-board Lufthansa FlyingLabs on the topics of the future of travel and virtual reality to San Jos, to the Fashion Week in New York, and to the digital conference South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin (Te). The topics of the FlyingLabs are coordinated with the respective event at the destination. We thereby offer our passengers a more efficient use of their travel time, and promote dialogue on board, says Dr Wingenter.;With the motto New Heights with Innovation, Lufthansa is hosting the FlyingLab together with SAP, and thus with together with a company for the first time. Together with the SAP Innovation Center Network, Lufthansa Digital Innovations will shape the programme for the inflight conference. The hosts, Dr Torsten Wingenter and Upen Barve, who heads the Department of Customer Strategy & E at the SAP Innovation Center Network, passengers will be welcomed in Frankfurt with a SAPPHIRE NOW gate event. The largest SAP customer conference will take place from 16 to 18 May in Orlando.;You can find more information at: ;Future of Travel: From VR to FlyingLab;Dr Torsten Wingenter;Head of Digital Innovations, Lufthansa;Upgrade and Biohack Your Travel Habits;Teemu Arina;Serial Technology Entrepreneur, Author, Biohacker;Build a future we want to live in;Martin Wezowski;Chief Designer, SAP;Robots -The Future of Work?;Ingrid Rothe;Senior Vice President Operations, RSB Partners;Corporate Innovation at the Otto Group;Michael Backes;Managing Director, Otto Group Digital Solutions GmbH;The future of products is data;Dave Mathews;Founder and CEO, NewAer;(4);Lufthansa promotes German-Chinese cultural e.5 million passengers flew with the Lufthansa Group Airlines in August;Star Alliance launches Connection Service at Chicago OHare;of;MORE INFO;DOWNLOAD;Media Cart;MORE INFO;DOWNLOAD;Media Cart;SHARE;MORE INFO;DOWNLOAD;Media Cart;MORE INFO;DOWNLOAD;Media Cart;SHARE;ID:;ID:; (All Fields Required) ;You must complete additional steps or remove assets to resume downloading.; (All Fields Required) ;Your Media Cart has been sent to:;You must enable cookies in your browser to use the Media Cart feature.; Thank you for getting in touch with us, well get back to you as soon as possible. ; Some items have been removed from your Media Cart because they are no longer available or e. ; '",lufthansagroup,2,18,174.106,0.2,-0.25,n,y,n,n,n,-0.0289445321,0.0096943454,-0.0107522932,-0.0463498576,-0.0099294129,4624,288,6.2283737024,37.78,n,n,y,y,y,5,4,3,1,2

Most of the time you have to download a driver or app, wait for it to install, locate the printer in the office you visiting and then map to it. When time is of the essence and you need an important document for that big meeting, these e steps can be confusing and frustrating. That angst over mobile printing may soon become a thing of the past. Xerox has joined with other print providers to launch the , a non-profit membership organization focused on making it easy to print from any mobile device to any printer. How does it work? In a move towards establishing industry-wide mobile printing compatibility on all printing devices, the MPA designed a single mobile print platform that will be adopted by its members and embedded into their products. In addition, the MPA created an easily recognizable brand and logo, Mopria (which stands for mobile printing), that will help identify which devices are part of the MPA. If a printer has a Mopria sticker on it, anyone with a smartphone and an Internet connection can walk up and print to it without downloading an app or driver. It really that easy. Take a look around your office. Can you spot a smartphone or two? Mobile phones are common tools not only for traveling workers, but for office e as well. According to IDC, 40 percent of employees use their smartphones on the job. In the ne three years, that e to increase to 56 percent. With BYOD on the rise, easier mobile printing is a must and allowing users to print from any device without complicated downloads is the first step. Of course print providers like Xerox and the other founding members of the MPA benefit too. We be able to ensure ongoing compatibility with mobile devices without having to continually re-engineer our products. Most importantly, by sharing a common mobile printing platform, all of our customers will be able to print freely and get the work they need to get done faster. We realize that our customers don want to think about how to print when they in a rush to meet a deadline or head into an important meeting. Now they won have to. Pretty neat idea. This seems like a great advancement if this uniformity can be facilitated. Thanks for the information. Smart and timely idea. Great article (e where is the definition for BYOD?) For clarity, BYOD = Bring Your Own Device. IDC welcomes this initiative by leading hardcopy equipment manufacturers like Xerox to simplify and streamline user print e from mobile touch points such as smart phones and tablets. E and long overdue! Fantastic move forward in standardising mobile print technology. This will ultimately aid businesses and user alike to interact with the numerous printer & MFD brands in the market today. Another step forward in allowing businesses to develop and become more effecient and profitable great news Good point Aaron and thanks for your comments. This will create the standard that enables printing to be universally compatible and easy for consumers and businesses. mopria is a key requisite for future moves of mobile print usage. It not just a nice to have me-too feature but an industry must to survive. Great innovation. Whatever the mind of a man can thing it can achieve. This is a great move to ease customer life inthe process of printing documents.

b'https://digitalprinting.blogs.xerox.com/2015/01/06/three-essential-sales-activities-and-targets/',1,8,66.924,0,87.387,0,4,17,622,21,1,"b'I have seen all sorts of odd targets. These have included the minimum time spent at meetings and even the most efficient driving routes. Some targets are more useful than others. Many people are tasked with a minimum number of quotes every month. There a temptation to ask for quotes just to meet a target. It keeps the estimators busy but it doesn turn into much business. So here are three rather more useful targets that you might consider setting for yourself or your team. The first one is about what you do. It always important to make sure that sales people are carrying out the right activity. So I would e them to be measured on the number of calls and visits made. However, it often useful to e this target beyond the basics. You might set social media activity targets, networking goals or a number of customer-focused events to attend. I a great believer in setting targets according to the strengths of different people. Not everyone should receive the same call targets. If someone is better at getting results from social media, then their targets should focus around this rather than cold calling. But we all know that sales is about more than how active you are. The majority of sales people in the print industry are measured on turnover. It certainly important to keep the presses running. However, it just as important to make some money! That why I believe that it important to measure the profit margin achieved on jobs. If sales people are, in part, rewarded on profit they will tend to negotiate harder with customers. There one final area that I want to discuss. Many companies have an ideal customer. They also have an ideal type of product to produce. It can be worth setting targets that encourage your sales people to focus on these types of clients and jobs. Consider setting a higher reward rate for wins in these areas. Naturally, there is one issue with all targets. No matter what targets you set, someone at your company will probably have an issue with at least one of them. Remember that this is normal behavior for sales people! They like to have as easy a set of targets as possible! Perhaps it time to point out that at least you haven set targets that involve minimum meeting time and efficient driving routes!

We discussed why many differences those in the print industry tout nothing to buyers. And we learned three important ways to check if your difference will work or not. Understanding this theory is important. But sometimes it much easier to see things in practice. So that why I going to share five e of differences that you might apply to your company. Here it goes: One way to show difference is to show how you understand a particular market. For e, you might specialize in serving a particular type of business. Even better, you might do this in your local area. Remember, these don have to be the only type of customer that you serve. But they are the ones you focus on when you are talking to prospect in the same sector. Do you have a specific process that you have developed? This can be a great way to stand apart from the competition. For instance you might have a specific checklist that makes sure web-to-print projects go correctly. As long as your prospect understands how you use this to do things differently from the competition you have a powerful difference. A number of printers have very unusual , or create unusual products. This can be an effective way to show difference to prospects. However, be aware that, if the product or process becomes more popular, you may have to create a new difference. This type of difference is more of a first mover advantage. Previous results can also make you stand out. For e, you can be remembered as the printer that creates 27% higher ROI for catalogue mailings. I once came across a printer that included the company hamster mascot on all its publicity. The hamster became a real hit. Lots of buyers wanted to know more about it, and how it was doing. There was even some discussion about hosting a hamster cam! Sometimes the oddest things can make you stand out and engage buyers. Remember, your difference is often a branding e. Buyers want a reason to put their preferred supplier above the competition. The difference helps with this. In reality, it can be hard to be truly different. But applying some of these ideas will let you stand out from the competition. If you run all three e successfully, you will be well on the way to truly standing apart from the competition.

There always an opportunity to add more memory, purchase a faster processor or upgrade some feature of the product. It is usually not a huge amount e to go for the upgrade. As a result, over the years I have spent a fair bit more on Apple products than I had meant to. It is easy to add an e sentence to a quotation, highlighting how a customer could upgrade a product for a small cost. If your quoting software doesn allow you to do this easily, the upgrade offer can be outlined in the cover e-mail. Here are some e of upsell opportunities: Here the main reason why upgrades can be such a worthwhile strategy. Offering upgrades is not about increasing turnover. It about increasing profit margins. In most instances the price of the main product being bought will need to have a fair market price. In today business environment that means there is unlikely to be a high profit margin. However, the upgrade option offers the opportunity to change this. Most buyers are very careful to research the initial product they are purchasing to ensure they are getting a good deal. However, after committing themselves to that specific purchase and supplier, they are often less price-resistant when it comes to e and upgrades. Upgrade options are most powerful when used with regular clients. They are less likely to be price checking against the competition. They are more likely to trust your pricing. In addition, you know these clients better. You are more likely to be able to suggest an upgrade option that absolutely suits them and their business. Remember also that smaller businesses are more likely to purchase an upgrade. They have more immediate freedom in how they specify their print. Your best clients may soon be spending quite a lot of e money with you. Just like I do with Apple.

Two completely separate print processes. Two distinct workflows. A big difference in the types of product that each process is suitable for. Many companies even go so far as to set up separate litho and digital departments or divisions. With all these distinctions, shouldn we be looking at a very different type of sales person for digital print? Don they need a completely separate training programme? Let take a step back for a moment and look at things from the customer perspective. Remember, the average person that buys print these days doesn understand print. They don know that there are different print processes. They don want to know about this. Therefore printing companies shouldn make a distinction between digital and litho for their customers. There don need to be different departments. You don need separate training for digital sales people. That because their skills are not focussed around selling print. They realise that the sale does not depend upon the print process. Their skills are focussed on the customers needs. A good sales person will: This should apply to all sales people, whether they are in the printing industry or not. It should apply to sales people no matter what sort of printing company they represent. There are two areas that may differentiate digital sales people from others. The first of these is in product knowledge. Clearly, digital print has a much broader range of solutions. Many of these are more complex than litho solutions. A digital sales person will need a better knowledge of digital products and services. They will need to know how these processes can help their customers. So they should have a good understanding in areas such as: Naturally, not all of these will apply to all companies. It depends on the products and services that you wish to focus your sales on. Secondly, you may want to think about compensation arrangements. As digital print is typically based on a larger number of smaller print jobs, commission might be structured different from litho. When it comes to selling digital and litho, the basic principles are not that different.

Oct 24, 2016 Jan 19, 2016 The conventional wisdom regarding the challenge of selling digital, of course, is that the client investment is the same, but the run lengths are shorter and the $ are smaller, so the ROI for the salesperson isn as great as litho. For print management, this is where different compensation models and the focus on selling recurring programs becomes critical.

You are often distracted. Why wouldn you be? You are probably doing 10 or so jobs at once, any one of which can jump out and become an emergency at any time. Despite how hard it is, you must be able to stay focused. Here are four things you can start doing today to be more focused in your small business. 1. Set daily work goals. I leave my desk clean each night e for the one piece of paper that lists out my 5 target tasks for the ne day. I start each day by 8am and I try to complete my 5 priorities before 11am. It called the 5 before 11 system. I learned it from a great book called by Allyson Lewis. I been using this system for years; it really works. 2. Keep conference calls to 30 minutes. No one needs to talk to you for an hour. When people want to talk to you, give them a 30-minute window. Make sure you know why you are spending time with them and what the call is designed to accomplish. Establish your own conference call line, so that you can call-in from anywhere that you are. You may not want the person you are talking to have your personal cell phone number. 3. Check email only three times a day. It easy to become distracted by email, especially if all of your social media accounts dump into your email. Turn off the alert feature so that you are not drawn to it. It ok for people to wait 2-3 hours for a response. If it urgent they should to pick up the phone. 4. Meticulously track your time easy to lose track of the time you spend on a work projects and social media marketing. Often, independent contractors find themselves spending more time on a project than they put into the proposal. It is up to you to ensure that you getting paid for the work you putting in and to complete projects in a timely manner. Be sure to include project management time in your bids; interaction with clients eats up lots of time. Try using a low cost service like to track your time and generate accurate invoices.

A small business, also called a mom and pop store by some in the United States, is a business that is privately owned and operated, with a small number of employees and relatively low volume of sales. Small businesses are normally privately owned corporations, partnerships, or sole proprietorships. The legal definition of varies by country and by industry, ranging from fewer than 15 employees under the Australian Fair Work Act 2009, 50 employees in the European Union,[2] and fewer than 500 employees to qualify for many U.S. Small Business Administration programs.[1] Small businesses can also be classified according to other methods such as sales, assets, or net profits.

From this point onward, machines are assumed to e and can therefore be started and stopped. This is indeed possible in Azure, but a closer look reveals that it is not a natural fit with the Azure cloud paradigm.;The first clue is seen when creating an Azure machine. After creating the machine, the machine is running and there is no other option as Azure assumes that the machine was created because it was needed for some immediate purpose. However, the convention for XenDesktop catalogs is that machines are initially stopped so after creating each machine in the catalog, we stop it which is time consuming and, as we shall see, unnecessary.;The second clue is seen when inspecting the stopped machines in the Azure Portal. The power state is reported as Stopped (deallocated). There is no Azure compute charge for machines in this state so it stands to reason that the machines do not e. When we stopped the machine immediately after Azure had allocated it, Azure deallocated the machine to avoid compute charges to the subscription. The reflection of the machine in the Azure Portal is really more of a record of how the machine is configured in terms of disks, network interfaces etc.;The third clue is seen when starting a Stopped (Deallocated) VDA where the power state in the Azure Portal will briefly show Creating. What happens when the VDA is started is not much different from what happens when the VDA is initially created.;This means that that the time it takes to start an e machine is comparable to creating a new machine. Armed with this information, it can be seen that it makes little sense to create machines when a catalog is created because they are effectively deleted immediately without being used. Furthermore, it means that instead of just stopping machines when they are not needed, they can be deleted. In subsequent sections, we will e how this translates into improved power operations performance and reduced storage costs.;Philosophically, one of the ideas behind the cloud is that resources scale up and down depending on demand and we have taken the first step towards a more dynamic cloud idiomatic view of resources.;Before we look at the mechanics of starting machines, we need to review the difference between pooled and dedicated XenDesktop machines. Pooled machines are always reset so they start with an OS disk that is an e copy of the master image while dedicated machines start with the same disk and disk content they had when they were last used.;Resetting the OS disk is accomplished by recreating the machine with a new disk. In other words, the e machine and the old OS disk is deleted and the machine is then recreated with a fresh copy of the master image. Previously,the traditional XenDesktop workflow requested the OS disk reset immediately prior to starting the machine. This is no longer the case so we can move the cost of deleting the machine to the point in time where the machine is no longer needed. When the machine is needed it can simply be created with the correct disk.; of the advantages of this approach are:;Many factors like location and time of day influence performance. Performance characterics may chance at any time, but the following table is typical of the performance gains in the latest version of XenDesktop in Citrix Cloud:;Since we know that the OS disk for a pooled machine will not be reused when the machine is started after being shut down, there is no need to keep it in storage and incur storage charges for data that is no longer needed. Previously, the OS disk could not be deleted when the machine was not being used because the machine itself was not deleted and it is not possible to detach the OS disk. On demand provisioning now allows OS disks to be deleted when not in use because the machine is deleted. This can result in significant cost savings for customers that routinely shut down machines, e.g., outside working hours.;Because the new on demand provisioning model is superimposed on the e XenDesktop product, there are some differences to be aware off:;Resources in Azure are subject to subscription quotas and the network interface and core quotas are particularly illustrative. Before starting a lengthy provisioning process, we verify that the subscription has sufficient network interfaces and compute cores available. Other quotas and conditions are verified, but we will ignore those for the purpose of this discussion.;Lets assume we are creating a catalog with N machines or adding N machines to an e catalog. Before provisioning the N new machines, XenDesktop makes sure that the subscription has capacity for N additional network interfaces and N times number of cores per machine cores. While the network interfaces are allocated as part of the provisioning process, the cores are not since the machines are created on demand when needed.;While some or all of the machines are powered off, cores can be used for some unrelated purpose and there may therefore be an insufficient number of cores available when the provisioned machines are started. Generally, this does not happen provided there is a reasonable relationship between core quota and network interface quota, but it is the users responsibility to assure that sufficient cores are available when starting machines.;Ole Larsen is a Senior Software Engineer with the Microsoft Solutions Team at Citrix.

But do printers need a blog? There are tons of blogs around. Does anyone read a printer blog anyway? Is it really worth the effort? As a long-time blogger both for the industry at large and on behalf of private clients, I reached out to the reader communities to ask these very questions. Do you read printers blogs? If so, why? If not, why not? What benefit do printers blogs serve? This is what I consistently hear over and over again. Today search engines don simply hone in on keywords. They know when a page contains good content the content is regularly updated. Blogs that reside on your website are searchable, and meaty blogs with good headlines and regularly updated content are more highly visible and appealing to search engines. When a company is looking for new suppliers, especially those offering something unique (unusual mailer shapes, specific coatings, metallic inks), they Google it. Post content about the types of jobs you do, and be specific. If someone has a digital print project that needs silver metallic ink, your post on quality and prices isn going to get you found. However, a post about your e service offerings with the gold and silver metallic ink on your new will. Before someone picks up the phone and calls or sends you an inquiry by email, they will check out your website. If you have a blog, they take a look. Within a few seconds, they will have formed an opinion about you. Does this company have e in their area of need? Do they specialize in certain vertical markets? so, which ones? Are there case studies? Who are their clients? You may want to avoid posting business content about the economy, trends in your client industry, or HR strategies. This is content that can be found anywhere and has nothing to do with print. From a prospect perspective, poor or irrelevant content is worse than no content at all. Visitors will also look at how recent the posts are. your last post from August 2014? Or from a week or two ago? How frequently are you posting? If it only once every six months, the blog looks like an oversight. If you set up a blog and don follow through, it reflects on your professionalism and business commitment. Again, if that the case, you probably better off not having a blog at all. So the answer to, you need a blog? is that a good, regularly updated blog with specific, relevant content can really help you. But if you post irregularly and post general or outdated content that isn specific to your area of e, it not only ineffective, but it could work against you. If you going to put up a blog, do it right. Post relevant, high-quality content and post on a regular schedule.

Who are we talking about? Our colleagues in Cape Town and Berlin who monitor the social media channels; hence, carry out research for their responses, patiently answer service requests regarding luggage and rebookings and politely respond to sometimes emotionally charged complaints. They face every shitstorm and love their job. That\'s why many of our customers love them so much so that a colleague was recently asked by a follower whether she would like to marry him.;: The social media team at Lufthansa in Touch monitors all comments and answers questions that are asked on Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Instagram. We also answer questions in the Flyertalk and Vielfliegertreff (frequent flyer rendezvous) forums. In Berlin, we work from 6:00 to 20:00 Monday through Friday.;: We in Cape Town take over at night and on weekends. We respond to every request within an hour we at least tell people that we have to do some research before we can reply to their query.;: We\'re a mi bunch. Some of us have studied tourism management; others have a marketing or legal background.;: At both sites, everyone starts with general reservations, then looks after the Miles & More status customers, then HON Circle members. After that, you\'re ready for social media!;: You acquire a broad range of knowledge working in the call centre. We get a lot of questions about flight bookings, luggage, Miles & More thats useful when you have to answer questions spontaneously.

In 2016, more than 400,000 posts across all channels were dealt with in Cape Town and Berlin.;: In Cape Town we work when everyone else is free something that\'s not to everyone\'s liking. The shift work we have to do also has disadvantages. But each one of us appreciates the variety because we can carry out research autonomously: on the phone, you either know the answer or dont.;: We enjoy being funny at times. Our conversations with customers can often be very amusing. Sometimes, they ask us for really absurd, comic things. One e that immediately comes to mind is the guest who asked the flight attendant on board whether Lufthansa had condoms for passengers in the on-board pharmacy. This question was answered with no, neither in the on-board pharmacy nor in the on-board shop. His question to us was: ""Is Lufthansa planning to include them in its on-board portfolio?"" Unfortunately no!;: This is, of course, less pleasant especially if there was no specific reason, but they\'re just writing to get things off their chest. Handling written complaints, however, is a lot easier for us than complaints made over the phone. When you write, you can read through your answer again.;: We often think about all the funny things we would like to write, but, of course, we don\'t. Any annoyance soon vanishes when were forced to have a good laugh about it. And it\'s always a great feeling when we\'re able to help angry customers and they thank us.;: Yes, we\'ve grown really fond of some of them! For e, we gave someone Lufthansa towels as a wedding present.

This printer had a customer who had rejected a poster that had been produced. The digitally printed poster didn match a litho leaflet that the customer had. So the printer asked for a copy of the leaflet (which they had never been given in the first place). They reprinted the poster for free. The colour was now pretty close. But it wasn an e match. So the customer rejected it again. The printer spoke to me because he didn know what else he could do for the customer. He knew that the customer would keep on rejecting it until he had an e colour match. But an e colour match might never be possible. I don match the colour e, he never going to pay me, said the printer. done this to me before. In this case, the cost of the job wasn worth trying to put right. The customer was demanding what might be impossible. The printer had already shown goodwill in reprinting for free. When I heard that it wasn the first time that the customer had done this, alarm bells started ringing. This was someone who was costing the printer a lot of money. Many people tend to look at the cost of these customers in terms of losses on individual jobs. In this e, the printer would be running at a loss after reprinting. This would happen even if he managed to persuade the customer to pay. However, the true cost of these customers is far greater. As well as the job production costs, there are the costs of servicing them. Clients like these are never simple to manage. The time in communicating with them typically far outweighs the time spent on other customers. But many other customers are much easier and nicer to deal with. The other big cost comes in the form of the opportunity cost. How else could you be using that time spent dealing with problematic customers? You could be upselling more profitable clients. You could be winning new clients. You might even be spending this time with friends or family. It wasn worth the time or effort in dealing with them. They were better off firing them. Sometimes we are too scared to fire a customer, even though we know that it the best thing to do. Some companies have more customers that they should fire than they realise! Firing certain customers can have a very positive impact on your business. But which ones should you fire? I deal with this in more detail in my ne article.

I\'d say, internally there havent been a lot of surprises and in terms of the substance of the role, I had the benefit of having seen a lot and being pretty deeply involved in most aspects of the firm and its businesses, geographies, functions, et cetera. But in terms of the e environment, I don\'t know if you\'d call them surprises, but theres never been a dull moment in the past 18 months.;I started on August 6, 2015. Just a couple of weeks later markets swooned, fueled by China fears. Early in the first quarter of 2016, we all remember, maybe we cringe in remembering, how the overall equity market pulled back, the energy price correction, credit spreads widening dramatically, in that January-February time period. Second quarter looked like we are having a relatively boring quarter and then in the last phase of June we had Bre, and then of course, we had the U.S. political surprise, the election in November of 2016. So it has a really been a pretty interesting time, always something new and different to react to and understand.;But being in the role during those different events really gave me an up-close appreciation for how resilient the firm is and our model is in the face of all that and moreover, how we\'re able to be opportunistic in environments like that and find opportunity.;So go back through those events that I mentioned. What happened in August of 2015, and its effect on the markets overall affected how the REIT market traded in the fall of 2015 that, I think, created the conditions for our Real Estate business to do a couple of really big deals, taking private BioMed, taking private Strategic Hotels, that was like $15 billion in aggregate and within the subsequent 12, 14 months, we substantially e our Strategic Hotels deal in a quick period of time, and the BioMed deal is going really well. We\'ve sold a good chunk of the assets, and we really like the position we\'re in.;Take then for e, the first quarter pull back in the energy markets. We had done very little in the prior year in terms of new upstream investments. We had sold a fair amount. Oil comes down to $30 or so, lots of turmoil and distress and that really set the stage for in the last 12 months our doing, I think, eight upstream oil and gas deals, about $3 billion of equity in our Private Equity area, and then more in our Credit area. So, again, a lot of opportunity there, and we set up a number of these deals and priced them in the first and second quarter at a time of great distress, and closed them later in the year. The prices per acre that we own those at and other valuation metrics look really good in relation to trades that happened only months later. And then you take Bre we bought assets in our real estate business out of a UK-listed open ended fund that was under tremendous pressure. We purchased them literally in the 7 to 10 days after Bre.;I just use those as e of what I\'ve seen in that time period and the opportunities that were created.;I\'d say, in terms of kind of the big picture opportunity there\'s tremendous and deep opportunity in the alternative asset market. There is a $35-or-so trillion global pension market, something like over $10 billion of U.S. retail assets that we consider long-term addressable for us. In a world of low rates, and where long-term return targets for institutional investors, are somewhere in the mid-single digits, alternatives continue to be an essential part of their portfolios, to have any hope of meeting their long-term liability obligations of 6%, 7%, 8%.;Against that, we\'re in a very privileged position, I think. We have 30 years of performance and with our record, our relationships with our investors, and our model and our platform, we are in a position where when we have good ideas, new ideas, new initiatives for funds or businesses, investors will back those initiatives and fund our new businesses.

One topic of conversation that hasn taken off as widely as e in the past couple years is . While first thought it seems like an o some ask: you get a mobile device to eliminate paper? . Now, there are solutions that make it easier than before by printing from your mobile device to any printer wherever you are. Why does it matter to you and your business? already benefiting from it, our sales team have tablets and use print n share to print the receipts and other paperwork out, instead of having to come back to the office to print! Good article Breanna a heard another stat recently that supports this idea of common work processes moving from desktop to mobile devices. According to Litmus (Email Analytics, Sept 2012), more email is being read on mobile devices than in desktop email clients or via webmail interfaces. With that much information being processed on mobile devices, other desktop-centric capabilities like print will naturally be required for people to be able to accomplish their jobs. I found that stat, and there are many others, at this page: Penny That a plus! Great to hear. Rob Good add and thanks for sharing the stats. I also find myself accessing my email more on my smartphone, especially when I not tied to my desk for the day. It seems like a natural transition to rely on our mobile devices when we can afford to leave our laptops or other bulky technology behind. Very nice article. I hard this before and my conclusion is that printing will never end. You can take all your documents in a mobile device, but if you are in a meeting or even looking for a new job, you probably face situations where a printing is needed. How would you manage that if you don have the right tools on your device? Certainly the industry should pay attention to this problem. People change faster than companies. Thats why I think we will need more time to get into a virtual world. We are using tech stuff and mobile is helping us to have more global presence. Meetings are happening virtually more than ever, but you will always see papers on the table. Its our culture and it will tank longer to change.

To get used to it, he set himself the task of trying to sell to anyone who came close to him. If you were within two metres of this person you became a sales prospect. One day he introduced himself to someone while in a lift. That person eventually became a client. He was converted because the sales person carried out an e quick introduction. So the idea of the elevator pitch was born. An elevator pitch is the sales introduction you would use if you met someone in a lift. You would have a very short time to introduce yourself. You would have to make the other person want to find out more and have a longer conversation. Naturally, the elevator pitch is normally used well away from a lift! In my ne article we cover seven places you should use your pitch. These days most people decide if they are interested in buying a house or not within 60 seconds of walking through the front door. You often have even less time to get a prospect interested in you and your print services. That why a good elevator pitch is essential. It your key to starting to build a relationship with a prospect. It creates an opportunity to control the conversation. It your chance to achieve the sale. So what makes a good elevator pitch? The first step in an elevator pitch is to state that you work with companies like your prospect. (This assumes that the prospect is the right sort of company for you.) Ne, talk about the problems that prospects like these typically face. You may want to carry out some research on current clients to make sure that your elevator pitch will work. Thirdly, state that you can solve these problems. You shouldn go into great detail about your services here: you just want to get you prospect interested. Finally, state why they should choose you or your company to solve these problems. Try and make this really memorable. I Matthew Parker, Champion of Print at Profitable Print Relationships. I work with printing companies. Typically, I find that my clients are: I help my clients solve these issues with a range of training and mentoring services. They choose me because I used to be a print buyer. Over my career I have received sales approaches from over 1,400 printing companies: I know what works and what doesn. I find this pitch works well with my prospects. But some people do not get the results they want from their elevator pitches. Many people make their elevator pitches too general. It best to focus on a specific type of prospect. You can be all things to everyone. Therefore, you may need a number of elevator pitches to cover different situations. If you use this guidance to put together your own elevator pitch, you be able to introduce yourself well. You will have a good chance of converting prospects in all sorts of situations. Even if it in a lift!

Valuation in Tech is driven by growth. Appro 80% of public sector valuation revenue multiples can be attributed to a companys growth rate and theres an over 90% correlation between earnings multiples and earnings growth. Beyond growth, important factors are things like sector leadership, long term margins at scale, and operating history. One of the reasons we are seeing companies in the Internet space come to market with Rare Air valuations -;is the best e, while;and;are Knocking on the Door andZyngaand;are in the wings is they have a very solid mix of these basic components though both Zynga and Groupon have shorter operating histories than LinkedIn and Pandora. Theres also a great deal of scarcity value there arent very many companies like this. As a result, there is strong demand and they trade at a premium to their peers. Combine this shortage with the fact that growth has slowed in the public markets for Tech to around 10% overall, while the median Tech IPO since 2010 is growing at a median of 26% year over year, and an average of 38% (sample size of 51).;EM: Longevity builds an impression in investors minds that these companies arent going anywhere. Both are companies that have been through both good markets and bad markets and not only survived but thrived. An institutional holder of the stock may see ups and downs, but these kinds of companies are unlikely to go out of business in 12 months. Which sounds funny, but it did happen back in the 2000 bubble. Could it happen again? Longevity + track record lowers the risk profile.;EM:;wasnt profitable when it went public either. And youd loved to have bet the farm on that one 5 years ago (Amazon recently crossed $100B in market value). The key is finding companies that can scale and achieve a high level of profitability over time. LinkedIn and Pandora are both doing more than $150M in annual revenue with growth rates of more than 100% annually. Investors get comfortable with the valuations by doing a forward projection of how profitable these companies may be at scale think $500M or $1B in annual revenue or more. Growing at 100% annually, it wont take long to get there. What are perhaps harder to understand are the private market valuations for companies with less than $100M in revenue and not a lot of longevity. You can make the argument that the private market is way out in front of the public in terms of valuation and rare air. Will we see IPO downrounds (where the company goes public at a valuation lower than its last private round)? Could be interesting.;EM: The first thing they do is plot themselves on the chart, of course. Its humbling. There are a lot of great companies on that chart and it is not an easy feat to break out of The Pack. It puts some very basic conte around IPO and M&A valuations.;EM: Id point to a few trends. One, deals are taking a long time to get done. Boards are increasingly cautious. Two, larger cap players seem to be more interested in transformational deals versus programmatic e. Theyre willing to play big stakes poker and bet on a larger deal than play lots of hands at the small stakes table. Look at the recent deals by;and;. We arent seeing a ton of companies getting acquired after filing an S-1 either which has often been a way to bring buyers to the table. Third, in the Internet and Software sectors in particular, there just arent a lot of buyers. We dont have a ton of companies with $5-10B+ market caps and cash war chests. That leaves a few large buyers, who dont generally feel like they need to pay up for a rising star which will become a product line. The deals you do see getting done are the big stakes poker deals -;, Google/Motorola, Microsoft/Skype, etc.;EM: Absolutely. I think what youre seeing is the market is already rewarding companies that are hugely disruptive with scale and high growth. Facebook, Zynga, Twitter, Groupon,;,;, etc. These are all companies being valued very highly in the private markets.; ;/;To receive email notifications when press releases or Byron Wien\'s Market Commentaries are posted, sign up for email alerts here. ;This website uses cookies, including third-party cookies, which allow Blackstone to obtain information about your visit to the website.

Whether above the clouds or on the ground the Lufthansa Group is reacting to customer preferences with tailor-made digital offers.

We offer our clients state of the art technology to respond to their requests and provide them with the best possible support for their journeys, says Harry Hohmeister, Member of the E Board of the Lufthansa Group and responsible for the Hub Airlines.

Let us surprise you, said Harry Hohmeister, speaking at the ITB. ;The new business class seat doesnt only represent quality and customization it is also an e of a new strategy within the Lufthansa Group: an ever increasing joint responsibility for processes. For instance, the new seat was developed for the network airlines Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines and Swiss collectively. The sales division was also restructured last year, across all Lufthansa Group hub airlines. Heike Birlenbach, Senior Vice President Sales Hub Airlines Lufthansa Group, emphasizes: Standardized processes across all three hub airlines and shared structures reduce comple and make our customers and sales partners the central focus of everything we do.

Here are four questions that James suggests you ask yourself when considering moving to a single vendor: Having the guy show up at your door each time takes the guesswork out of understanding how important your partnership is to the vendor. Low turnover and high product knowledge provided by Xerox is invaluable to The MPS Group, can count on Xerox to share people, products, tools and pathways to success. Too often vendors have new releases that are in high demand with the end customer, but aren readily available. Selling a product only to find it on back order is not good for business. James says, earned The MPS Group trust by having new products available as soon as they released. sell it if you can service it. That one motto lives by. They are firm believers in after the sale, and choosing Xerox as an e partner helped streamline their service department. James, his team and their customers do not have time to rely on a vendor time frame, which can be very sporadic depending on the vendor.

Local technicians are trained in good customer services so even when The MPS Group can fix the problem, their end-users remain happy customers. The online training programs Xerox provides are top notch and one of the cornerstones of this partnerships success.

It was a company that had a lot of advertising clients in the music equipment industry. The publishing company knew when all the trade shows were due to happen. It was easy for them to check which of their clients were e. Months before each show, the publishing company would contact the relevant clients, remind them that the show was coming up and check what print they might need for the show. They sold an awful lot of print this way. Proactive selling is the technique where companies anticipate their clients needs. In the e above, the publishing company thought about their clients print requirements before the client did. They helped their clients organise everything in good time. Most importantly, if you practice proactive selling, you have a better chance of winning this work. The client would probably leave this type of print until the last minute. Then they may not call you: they may shop around for the provider who can offer the lowest price and quickest turnaround. This very well could be your competition. If a company leaves its e planning until the last minute, they may choose not to order any print at all. They may decide that they do not have enough time to organise all the printed collateral that they had thought of at the eleventh hour. A proactive sales call can even persuade a client to order more print than they had planned. Do they need a new e stand? Could they try out some new publicity materials? A call well in advance means a client has time to consider these new ideas. They also have time to put them into action. Most companies have times when they know they will need print. It is often easy to research: You may be surprised at how little planning many companies do for these sorts of events. Now you can profit from proactive selling as much as the publishing company.

Dec 10, 2015 Jan 11, 2016 Feb 11, 2016 Oct 13, 2016 I recently watched a great webinar on what print buyers want from their print vendors. Presenters came from State Farm, Synergent, and Starbucks. In every case, they mentioned proactivity as a critical element of the print buyer vendor relationship. Bring me new ideas. Offer suggestions to save money. Look for ways to improve the quality or effectiveness of my print jobs. Regardless of HOW they wanted their printers to be proactive, they wanted them to be proactive. And the ones that were continually bringing new ideas and offering suggestions were the ones most likely to continue to get the work. Thanks Heidi that another great way to apply proactivity. I think proactivity is great strategy in all areas of print!

It seems that the prospect just doesn get the point of what you are saying. It as if you can connect with them. Often this is because the customer prefers to understand information in a different way from how you are providing it. If you understand how someone is thinking it easier to e things in a way that makes sense for them. One way to understand the mind set of other people is to use the DISC model. Sales people who use this model will create better relationships with their clients. They have a better chance of controlling conversations. They are more likely to achieve their aims with their customers. The DISC model is an easy way to understand the basics about how another person thinks. The model splits people into those who are -based and those who are based. It also differentiates between active and passive people. This give four quadrants, or four different types of mind set. Image courtesy of www.OnlineDiscProfile.com people are interested about results: their results. They like to get straight to the point. They certainly don have time for small-talk. spend their time connecting and networking. They like to name drop. They are open to change but are sometimes not detail-focused enough to achieve as much as they might. people get on well with others. But they are not keen on change. They prefer things to stay as they are. people need to know every minor fact before they are prepared to make a decision. Sometimes they can see the wood for the trees. If you understand someone mind set, you can change your message to suit it. So, if you are dealing with a goal-focused person, you should focus on results. If you are dealing with an influencer, you might mention who else is using a similar solution. If you are dealing with a steady person, you may wish to emphasise how little change your proposal involves. Finally, with a detail person, you need to cover every tiny point. Focus on a prospect mind set and try and deliver a sales message in the way that resonates with. You may find that, suddenly, many customers become less difficult to deal with.

For the KitKat (4.4) version and above, Xerox developed a service plug-in which now makes it much easier to print from your Android smartphone to Xerox printers. This plug-in from Xerox does more than just but similar to desktop computer printer software you can manage stapling, finishing, secure print (using a pin code to release a print job) and more.

Right now, everyone is rushing to the because of the promise of and the advantages for . But, I e somewhere down the road the trend will move back the other way and that people will once again demand more local control of information and compute power. The concept of the duality of security is kind of Zen, isn it? I like that. What was my overall impression? Listening to the speakers, I started to think about why people continue to take risks online? Why is IT equipment still being installed on the network with defaults unchanged? Why are user accounts not being set up? Whitfield Diffie (left) and Ron Rivest (right) discuss security at RSA Conference 2012. For an answer I take an analogy from history. It took 50 years to go from the Model T to get the first . The death rate was alarming, but people loved their cars anyway. They just had to accept the risk if they wanted the personal freedom that a car brought them. I think we sort of in the same phase in terms of computer security, but we probably don have 50 years to get it right. We can count on the cycle time of the current era to help us there, but remember that it finally took government intervention to require seat belts and air bags. I think the answer is in many of the things discussed at the conference: better information sharing, better training and recruitment of new security professionals, and maybe most important, making security simple. Simple does not mean security is off. It means it on, but unobtrusive, running in the background, literally watching our backs as we go about our business.

As a channel partner, your customers mean everything to you. You have to keep the pulse on what they like because if you don, someone else could step in and take them away. Now, I been doing some research on customers and found, not surprisingly, that it takes a lot more time and money to land a new one than it does to maintain one. One of the easiest and least costly ways to hold onto those customers is through the creation of a loyalty program. From gas to groceries, frequent flyer miles to coffee, I know I hooked on these programs. I was absolutely thrilled when I took my family on a European vacation traveling on FIVE free United Airline tickets just for doing something I already do! Good for me. Good for the Airline. What many customers may not realize (or even care about) is that loyalty programs are less about immediate sales and more about understanding them, pinpointing their purchases, and getting useful information to provide a solution that better fits into their lives. Some of the programs I in are so personalized that I walk away feeling like they really me. And that the way I want to feel. So how can you apply this concept to your business? We developed an that gives you the perfect recipe for what goes into an impactful customer loyalty program a program that creates a stronger connections and win/win between you and your customers. Because if you don start cooking up a plan of action now, you might lose some fans. And do you know what that truly costs? (I do!) Lost business might have a bigger impact than you may think.

Reducing customer loss by just 5% can increase profits by up to 75% Many people will tell you costs more to acquire a new customer than retain an e one. The Customer Insight Group found it five to seven times more, but figures vary greatly by who you ask. For e, it costs Priceline.com $7 in marketing spend to get someone to use their travel services, while Sprint PCS shells out . But everyone seems to agree, myself included, that it way more e to forge a relationship than maintain one. A study by Rob Marley and Fred Reichheld for Bain and Company on found that high cost of acquiring customers renders many customer relationships unprofitable during their early years. Only in later years, when the cost of serving loyal customers falls and the volume of their purchases rises, do relationships generate big returns. So every time you lose a customer and acquire a new one, you essentially starting off on the slow road to profitability all over again. I feel your pain. In your B2B world, into their decision.

Beta Ni Going to Starbuck on Sunday mornings has become a family ritual. It has something to offer for each of us to enjoy, plus a welcoming environment that invites us to sit down and chat for a bit. After initially declining the barista repeated offer to join the Starbuck loyalty program, I am glad that I finally did. Within just a few months I had earnt Gold level status and delighting in a free Iced Caramel Macchiato. My one regret is that I did not take up the barista offer to join the program sooner. I would have been earning stars for our purchases all along my drink was delicious but the word is even more delicious. What this means, of course, is that my family devotes almost all our coffeehouse purchases to just one establishment. I even enter numbers from packs of Starbucks coffee purchased from supermarkets online to earn stars. Now that is loyalty, and that is worth money for Starbucks. As a businessperson, I can fully appreciate the value of loyalty. By keeping the customer attention focused on your brand, you essentially lock out your competition. The customer only has eyes for you. We all know how hard it is to acquire a new customer. It is even more difficult and costly to win them back after losing them. With so many you simply cannot ignore loyalty programs anymore. Having a loyalty program is a smart investment for Starbucks, and frankly, for any business transacting products in a competitive marketplace like cafes. But it is an investment. The costs for development and testing, marketing and promotion, maintenance and continuing development are significant and likely too costly for sole proprietors. What if you could have a loyalty program akin to Starbucks- but for printer supplies? One that is almost effortless to implement and to promote, that costs you nothing, and rewards your customers for purchasing supplies directly from you? How the Genuine Xerox Rewards loyalty program can lock out your competition While it might not be as delicious as a Caramel Macchiato, it is every bit as effective at cementing the relationship between you and your customers. It is called the program, and it rewards your customers for purchasing printer supplies from you. This short spells out how it works for your customer. Like the Starbucks loyalty program, members can see when they have enough points to go shopping not just free coffeehouse beverages and food. Instead, members have access to an on-line rewards catalog with literally millions of tempting choices. With digital downloads like music and e-books, to travel e, to merchandise of every sort yes, even a Starbucks gift card there really is something for everyone. Best of all, with your customers will only want to buy from you because you can provide them with a special promotional code unique to your business. This code can double, and in some cases, even triple their reward points. Why would they go elsewhere? Thanks to you, your customers get preferential treatment, earning free rewards faster, simply for buying printer supplies for their Xerox, HP, Brother, etc. printer. Bringing e value to your customers is ultimately the best way to strengthen your customer relationship. Continuing to promote the program to your customers will help you achieve this. Now some of them will be like me may need a few nudges to join the program and that is okay.

At the beginning of the year, no-one is too worried if you are behind with a big target. After all, there is plenty of time to make up for it later. This feeling can easily stay until the end of the first quarter. However, at that point you suddenly have to achieve a full year sales in just nine months. You are soon going to start seriously slipping behind with your figures. By the time you realize you are in trouble, it often too late to do anything about it. A shorter-term sales goal really focuses the sales person. They need to produce results in a much shorter time frame. That means that they get down to work straight away. If the sales target is missed, there is still the opportunity to meet the figures later in the year with another three-month sales project. However, sometimes sales people need to be focused on more regular activity. That where the ne goal comes in. Sales people should be able to accurately estimate what work they are likely to bring in over the ne few months. This can be achieved with a simple spreadsheet. It should be possible to estimate the monthly turnover of each prospect. This figure can then be multiplied by the number of months left in the year. This gives you the total potential new business for the remainder of the year. Naturally, you will not convert all this business! Therefore you should work out the percentage likelihood of you winning the business, depending of the stage of the sale. For instance, you may only estimate the likelihood of conversion at 10 or 20% if you have submitted a first quote. But the likelihood may be 75% if you are discussing schedules. You can work these percentages out according to your past sales performance. You now have an accurate estimate of the work you are likely to win over the coming months. Rather than setting a specific turnover for a sales person to achieve, it may be more beneficial to set activity targets. Targeting sales people with a set number of activities each week should ensure that you achieve the right results. Here are some of the targets you might consider setting: Whatever goals you set, remember one important rule: All sales people should have someone they report to. It may be a manger. Or it may simply be someone they have promised to report their activity and results to. Being accountable means that you really focus on achieving what you have been set. You may find that they create far better results than having an annual target.

And you dont have to delve very deep to find out that not only is Drew living with type 1 diabetes, but he is passionate about empowering others to manage their health through their lifestyle choices and e. Here,our newest Fitbit Ambassador shares a bit more about himself, in his own words.;Ive always considered myself to be a healthy person, but it wasnt until I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 23 that I began to understand the true meaning of the word. Ever since I was a kid Ive been intrigued with the human body, and have had a keen interest in science and nutrition. My love for all of those topics is what sent me on the path to becoming a qualified health professional.;Since being diagnosed with diabetes, the last five years have been one big self-e, and the cool thing isIve been the subject and the lead scientist. Ive made countless mistakes and discovered just as many solutions. Perhaps the greatest discovery of all is that a healthy lifestyle is not only an effective way for me to manage my condition, but it also allows me to thrive with my condition.;My typical day involves getting a dose of each of the pillars that I attribute to my health and fitness: E, Nutrition, Insulin & Blood Sugar Control, Daily Living, and Mindfulness.;I wake up with the sun and immediately go outside to spend time with nature. Most days this includes a swim in the ocean and a walk in the park with my dog. Walking and other forms of physical activity have proven to be an amazing way for me to manage my blood sugar levels, so I always make time for it.;In terms of nutrition, I eat real, whole foods, organic when possible. And when it comes to diabetes management, I check my blood sugar levels appro 15 times each day and administer insulin accordingly. Its important to note this really isnt a burdenit only takes a couple of minutes.;I also make time for research, reading, and writing to ensure I stay progressive with my knowledge. As a health consultant, I also meet my clients face-to-face to discuss their health and progress.;Finally, I always remember to play; be it with my dog, surfing, or playing an instrument.;I find my fit in a variety of different ways. I lift weights in the gym at least fouror fivedays a week, or if the weather is nice Ill train outdoors using my body weight. In the summertime, Ill do triathlon-style trainingrun, ride, swim.;Other times I find my fit it in the form of play. I love sport and activities, such as touch football, tennis, golf, rugby, surfing, and kickbo.;Im proud of the way that I have turned adversity into opportunity. Getting diagnosed with a chronic disease has the potential to either derail you or rebuild you into an even better version of yourselfand I chose the latter. The first year or so was tough, theres no denying that, but Im proud of the way Ive adapted and grown.I didnt choose to get diabetes, but I chose to take responsibility for how I reactedI guess you can say its in my blood (pun intended!).;I also take pride in the fact that Im not only managing my diseasebut also sharing my knowledge to educate thousands of people around the world and hopefully empower them to take control of their health so they can thrive, too!;Fitbit is more than just a brand that offers fitness trackers, it promotes positive habits to help people understand their own health trends, keeping them motivated to improve their overall well-being.;Fitbit allows me to collect and interpret health data, which I love! Its amazing how much motivation I get by simply wearing a Fitbit tracker on my wristIm held accountable and responsible for my activity levels. For me personally, active days are correlated with better diabetes management.;There are no secret e, supplements, programs, workouts, tips or tricks. Its a lifestyle. Its about getting the optimal dose of each aspect of health and fitness every single day!;In order to do so, you really need to define your why. What is your motivation for making healthy lifestyle choices? For me, its about managing my disease and preventing long-term health complications. Your motivation may be to live a long healthy life so that you can be there for your childs wedding or watch your grandchildren grow up. Whatever it is, discover your why and the entire process will become easier than ever before.; Harrisberg is a passionate sports scientist and diabetes educator who grew up with a fascination for all health-related topics. Following his diagnosis with type 1 diabetes at 23 years of age, Drew became inspired to educate others living with the condition on how to manage it and keep motivated to improve their overall health.; e physiologist, diabetes educator and sports scientist, Drew has come on board as Fitbits new ambassador in Australia and is committed to helping people improve their health holistically, by providing tips on sleep, nutrition, and e. Comments article and insights! Way to overcome adversity.;As a fellow diabetes educator (nurse) welcome to Drew. 5 yrs ago I was overweight and diagnosed with pre-diabetes, much to my shame.

In this configuration, different networks can be used for connecting virtual machines (using layer 2 Linux bridges) or for other uses such as host storage access (iSCSI, NFS), migration, display (SPICE, VNC), or for virtual machine management. While it is possible to consolidate all of these networks into a single network, separating them into multiple networks enables simplified management, improved security, and an easier way to track errors and/or downtime.;The aforementioned configuration works great but leaves us with a network bottleneck at the host level. All networks compete on the same queue in the NIC / in a bonded configuration and Linux will only enforce a trivial quality of service queuing algorithm, namely: pfifo_fast, which queues side by side, where packets can be enqueued based on their Type of Service bits or assigned priority. One can easily imagine a case where a single network is hogging the outgoing link (e.g. during a migration storm where many virtual machines are being migrated out from the host simultaneously or when there is an attacker VM). The consequences of such cases can include things like lost connectivity to the management engine or lost storage for the host.;A simple solution is to configure ;Continue reading ;Enter your email address to follow the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.;Join 1,804 other followers; 2017 Red Hat;Powered by """,redhat,6,32,207.642,0.2,-0.85,y,y,y,n,n,0.0071116862,0.0002201346,0.0014018463,-0.0679812283,-0.0254923723,5675,422,7.436123348,40.82,n,n,n,n,y,4,3,5,1,2

The button has a simple yet important purpose: It takes users to a secondary menu of applications on a computer. coarse, limited resolution tended to dictate very simple, clean designs for all the images. Photo courtesy of former visual and interface designer at PARC. Where did this icon originate? It was designed by Norm Cox of PARC for the Xerox Star workstation in the early 1980s nearly a decade before the birth of the World Wide Web. That was a whimsical era at PARC, when developers were tasked with building a new way of interacting with computers. Remember, this was a time when most people outside of a lab didn know their way around a personal computer. One task for PARC researchers was to introduce new ways to navigate around machines. challenge was daunting, but the creativity, the free e of ideas, and the opportunity to change the world was infectious, says Cox. environment fostered both heated debate and way-cool collaboration and camaraderie. Cutting-edge thinking, innovative ideas, and Peet coffee flowed unabated through the halls and meeting rooms. The designers at PARC in those early days of personal computing had a near-blank slate to work on. However, one limitation that they faced was the simple hardware of the day. The display was only black and white and the resolution was just 72 pi per inch. coarse, limited resolution tended to dictate very simple, clean designs for all the images, says Cox. has proven to be one of the many hallmark successes of the UI [user interface], as evidenced by the trend back to minimalism and simplicity in today GUIs [graphical user interfaces]. Mike Kuniavsky, a current researcher at PARC, is most impressed by the strategy that led to innovations such as the hamburger symbol. idea at the time was that if computers were easy enough for kids to use, then everyone else could use them, too he says. we can learn from the early research is how they looked at problems. At the time they saw that one of the greatest needs was making computers comprehensible to a wide variety of people. Learn how and ethnography to identify unmet needs, and recommend successful workflow practices. The now famous icon wasn associated with a hamburger when it was first created. often referred to it tongue in cheek as air vent to keep the window cool, says Cox. The idea for the icon developed from a need for a with a list of command buttons that either didn fit in the header, related to window control rather than to the contents, or were unrelated to the current conte of the cursor or selection within the window. In short, it was a button to see more menu options that were hidden from the main screen. Cox says two symbols were considered for this button. One was a downward pointing arrow in the shape of a triangle representing the direction that the menu would appear. The developers decided that this symbol could be misinterpreted as a pointer for directional instruction. Early PCs were difficult to work on. Here how Xerox researchers solved that problem. http:/ctt.ec/00jub+ http:/ctt.ec/f4M2Y+ The other symbol was the three-line image, which actually represented the look of stacked command buttons. was never a question as to how many lines it would be, since two lines looked like an equals sign and four were visually too many, says Cox. lines was the perfect number. How did such a simple design last for more than 30 years? hamburger symbol longevity, as well as that of many other PARC images, is a testament to its simplicity, utility, learnability, and memorability, says Cox. PARC, we quickly learned that there is no such thing as a perfect symbol to fit all users. About the best we could hope for is a simple, sensible, logical, learnable, and memorable symbol that becomes a part of our digital language and subconscious. we can learn from the early research is how they looked at problems. researcher at PARC, a Xerox company. (Photo courtesy of PARC, a Xerox company.) We are once again at a launching point for user interface design. Today, most people in the developed world know their way around a computer. They are reliant on different technology such as mobile devices and data storage in the cloud. Icons have become less relevant. App design has become more gestural than figurative today equivalent to GUI icons are the right means yes or to zoom gestures. Developers are also creating methods for people to interact with machine learning systems that behave autonomously and attempt to anticipate human behaviors. Kuniavsky says these developments have created new questions. How do we make sense of the flood of data? How can we manage large collections of devices that are making decisions on our behalf? What does it mean to have simultaneous, perhaps different, identities in the cloud and in person? questions have started to be lumped under the e design umbrella, he says. user e designers like me can learn from the early days, Kuniavsky notes, how they were able to step away from their assumptions to understand the underlying problems and create technology that addressed people needs and desires. and receive email updates when we publish a new article.

White spaces are the regions between boundaries (the bounds of disciplines or views or beliefs.) It is frequently within the white spaces that the most important problems are found and world-enlarging breakthroughs are achieved. One relevant e: At one time, computer scientists were focused on designing more powerful individual computers. The notion of enabling inter-computer communication and then enabling people to communicate and collaborate unleashed capabilities that boggle the mind and were not approachable by researchers focusing within their perceived bounds. Bringing together people with diverse outlooks and areas of e and intentionally addressing the white spaces has proved to be a very powerful tool for revealing consequential areas for progress. That funny. That was the question we asked ourselves when PARC opened 47 years ago. For e, we wondered if a paperless office was imminent. We envisaged two possible futures that would provide the affordances of paper including ease of interaction, low cost so that one could give the away, throw it away, et cetera but also provide the affordances of the digital world, including searchability, wide dissemination, reconfigurability, and more. I believe that technology evolution is pretty much co-evolution. In a humorous way, silicon and carbon (human) constructs are co-evolving. We design silicon devices and they modify our capabilities. We only feed the ones that seem compatible with our needs, and we strive to make them more capable. So we adapt to each other and evolve in a coupled manner. To predict the office of the future, I believe we have to focus on the affordances that we value now as well as the affordances that could be added. We should understand that there is not just one potential future. All futures are not only possible; they well may coe for many years. I believe we are on a fast path to achieving human prostheses like augmented and virtual reality tools that will allow us to be in a work place with global access to information and each other, no matter where we are.

Not purely because companies wish to become more sustainable, but many organizations understand that the increase in productivity by removing paper can have a significant impact on profitability. I believe in 2016 we will take another significant step towards eliminating paper with a vast increase in the use of document authorization via e-signatures. Find out how e-signatures can help you build a smarter document strategy Currently in many organizations documents are created, distributed and digested electronically, yet when it comes to authorization of a document many organizations still insist on physical paper. This process causes a massive impact on productivity. Let me give you an e of a typical sales process and the number of stages organizations go through to obtain a physical signature: Compare this process with one whereby the salesman emails the client the relevant document which is then securely authorized via e-signature and returned. No travelling to client, no paper produced (in this case saving the document being printed once then copied twice- with both copies probably being destroyed). When you see it like this you realise how archaic the old process was. This is why e-signature companies such as DocuSign, Adobe & Right Signature have made significant progress over the last 12 months. Last year , & , opening awareness to a vast new audience. With , DocuSign can be integrated with Word, Outlook and SharePoint allowing for easy and instant integration to e document processes.

We have also looked at how to choose the right customers to get rid of. By now you may have decided that you have one or two clients that are no longer right for you. You may be ready to say goodbye to them. So how do you go about this? One strategy is to talk to them before making a final decision. You may wish to talk with a customer and share with them how you feel about the relationship. If they have a sizeable turnover, it is worth making every effort to get things running smoothly and profitably. Some clients do not realise the problems that they are causing their suppliers. They may be prepared to change their ways. However, many problematic clients are set in their ways. They may also only have a small turnover. In these cases, it is not worth the time and effort to hold a meeting. Instead, you have two options. Consider raising prices with problem clients. Put your pricing at a level where you are happy to put up with these customers. You want them to be making you a good enough profit to make all the stress and time servicing them worthwhile. When you raise your prices two things can happen. Firstly, the client will decide to move to a cheaper supplier. Congratulations! You have now rid yourself of a client that you didn want. Some clients will continue to work with you. In these cases you now have a high margin client. They are now paying their way. Some clients will argue with price rises and demand the same level of service for their original pricing. There may also be some low-turnover clients that you no longer wish to deal with. They are too much trouble, no matter how high a price they are prepared to pay. That where the ne strategy comes in. Send these clients an e-mail or a letter. E to them that you have held a customer review. Give them a logical reason for ending the relationship. For instance, you could tell them that they now fall under a minimum turnover or quote conversion level. It is important to give them a logical reason: no-one likes to be told that they are being fired because they are difficult to work with! You should also consider giving these clients a fair notice period. This might typically be 30 days. This gives them time to find an alternative supplier. Remember, always end the relationship on a professional note. After all, you may eventually run into your contact at another company that you do want to work with. The sales person visited me to tell me that they no longer wished to work with my company. We had been giving them a lot of quotes. But they were winning very little work. It just wasn worth them spending their time producing all the quotes for us. They were better off investing this time in more profitable customers. It didn feel good to be given notice. However, when I thought about it, I realised that this decision actually helped us. We went on to source a supplier that was more suited to our company. I also recognised that the printer had made a sensible business decision. Make sure you make the same sensible business decisions for your company.

Just thinking about all of those nooks and crannies, the cleaning out of overflowing bo and drawers and then reorganizing. But once all the dust and clutter is gone, there is a magical sense of accomplishment we all get. Spring cleaning is not just for your home, though. Every business needs a thorough cleaning each spring as well. Whether you have stacks of paper lying around or your digital files are a mess, now is the time to bring order out of all that chaos. To help, we have four tips that will help you bring order and organization to your office environment. With spring around the corner, why not start motivating yourself now, so you will be ready to tackle some serious spring cleaning then? Here are some tips for spring cleaning your business, starting with your documents: Checklists are a great business tool, and they are not just for project managers. Checklists help business owners take stock of what going on in their business. Has everything been completed for that upcoming audit? Check. Are all your team members current on required training and certifications? Check. Is your business inventory properly stocked? Check. Once you wrap your mind around what you need for this year spring cleaning, be sure to have a or task management tool handy. It will help you track the various moving pieces, especially your office inventory, devices, supplies, and plan more efficiently for the year ahead regarding how much you need in paper, ink, printers, office equipment, cloud storage, software, and more. Spring cleaning presents an ideal opportunity to digitize essential office documents. Records management can get tricky, especially as more businesses move everything to the cloud. So, what happens when old paperwork resides in filing cabinets and new paperwork is in your digital management system? What happens is consolidation. It is the only way to bring order to your systems and ensure that your business will continue to run efficiently. While I do not think ditching paper records is the solution (because you never know when you might need a hardcopy backup), I do think everyone should store files digitally. Spring cleaning offers business owners the perfect opportunity to capture all your documents digitally and store them on either an e hard drive or in the cloud. All you need is a secure and reliable, document capture system, such as which streamlines the process for you. Offices can become very wasteful environments if you do not have a system for closely monitoring employee usage of your resources. Here are a few ways you can get control over your business waste and save money in the process: Lastly, spring cleaning is the perfect time to get a handle on your digital document workspaces. Clutter might not seem so bad when you are not physically tripping over it, but it can be just as harmful to over clutter your online storage spaces. There are a number of ways you can work on improving your digital workspace during spring cleaning: If you cannot make out your desktop background image anymore, it is time to clean it up. Create folders to store all your loose files. Better yet, get all those documents centralized online. The is the only solution that automates and scans a document for immediate use without additional steps of creating files, renaming documents and importing it to an application. There tend to be two types of email inbo: those that are under control with an inbox-zero mentality and those that pile higher and higher until you can no longer find anything. If you are the latter, spend some time with your email inbox getting it organized. Create special tags and folders for emails so you can easily find them and create special rules to move the less essential emails you get (you know those newsletters and social media updates!) to a folder that you can check at the beginning or end of the day and doesn distract you during peak times. Get a to cut costs and improve efficiency. It does not have to be e CRM or task management software if you cannot afford it right now. Even a Dropbox or Google Drive subscription will do. Just make sure all your company files are located in one place and can be easily accessed by your team. MFPs come preloaded with direct, secure access and out-of-the-box connectivity to Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, DropBox and the . William Morris once said, nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful. I think that sums up the goals of business spring cleaning. Just remember, the more order you can bring out of the chaos, the better off you will be to focus on running your business instead of locating the documents needed to manage it.

Information captured in an assessment lays the foundation for improving and optimizing your current environment plus your document workflow. Assessment tools can now take data capture beyond device-centric information to reveal document analytics detail. This provides useful information such as what applications are used in printing, like MS Word or Outlook. For e, if 30 percent of what an employee prints are emails, that signifies an opportunity to improve by limiting printing from Outlook. MPS capabilities have become quite sophisticated in how the enterprise print environment can be configured and optimized, and data from assessments drives this. from assessments and analytics go a long way toward helping enterprises identify and implement printing and document best practices. That especially important for a large, far flung enterprise, which faces bigger hurdles in evaluating and optimizing a global document environment. Here are some of the areas where an MPS assessment can lead the way to better practices: You can even plan for the future, much less e a strategy without the information from an assessment. The enterprise MPS assessment provides the basis to refine policies, save money and be more productive and effective. It tells where you are with your printing goals and how to reach them faster. When you meet with MPS providers, ask about how their assessments lead to better document environments. [] document-intensive business processes, devices (vendor and others) and locations.

In article from CMS Wire, they e the BYOD trend and technology that is helping companies develop solutions. As stated in the article, 46 percent of firms are making it a priority to develop a BYOD program this year. BYOD has many benefits, however there are also concerns including security. The importance of a BYOD strategy has led to the development of technology to help make these programs more manageable, secure and successful. In the article, they highlight technology that promises to help companies effectively design, manage, control employee access in a BYOD network and address employee adoption. This type of technology is a great way for companies to easily develop and implement safe BYOD solutions that allow employees to work securely from wherever. One area that I think is overlooked in an overall BYOD strategy is the need for companies to secure printing capabilities. In the past, employees have been confined to working in the office and whenever they have to print documents they are able to get to the printer quickly to ensure their documents aren picked up by other employee. Since employees are working from the road, their home or coffee shops, companies must make sure that their printers have security features like passwords in order to release print jobs so that confidential data isn lost. There is no way to get around the use of mobile devices in the workplace, so companies should make a concerted effort to embrace the trend and make sure their BYOD policies address all the areas of concern, especially security. Has your company used added technology to develop and manage your BYOD policy? What do you think is the most important thing for an organization to remember when they are taking this leap?

I must admit, I am a convert to this new media. It is not just a way for companies to tout their wares (probably it shouldn be) but it is a great way to get as close to the customers as you can without actually being there. Xerox for e, is using Twitter, social networks and blogs to communicate and build relationships with our customers, engage them in open discussion, and build consensus. Some of you pioneers of digital printing have made bold steps in social media, so what is stopping your colleagues from reaching out to their customers past, present and future? time to listen to your customers, or have them listen to you go off on a topic you love really is worth thousands of Dollars/Pounds/Euro spent on advertising. Making time to write a five minute blog on the way you see the local printing market, ways you can help your customers, or the way you see new technologies improving things is five minutes very well spent. you are in printing and running your own business today then believe me you have lots to say. Firstly, why do you do what you do? It a great way for new and e customers to find out about your love for printing and what your background is. It gives the human side of your business and really gives your brand a degree of credibility that is free. Passion about what you do will come over in a blog; of that I am sure. There are plenty of tools available to companies to get started in social media. Most of you have web sites already, and even if you don a forum, join a social network, start commenting on others blogs and get a feel for it. You be amazed at what you learn about your company, your peers, the industry, and your competitors. Social networking to drive variable data. Use an on-line form as a way for customers to give you the fields and images to drive sales. Customers can catagorize themselves and let you know what the variable data should be!

Baldaro from Xmpie maintains and updates a List of UK printers that tweet and that contains less than 60 when I last looked. Do you know the source of the research? Hi Jacky! I saw this same statistic from a study published by WhatTheyThink called . I agree with you that although 57% are using social media, to what e? For business purposes, some may watch videos, others may participate in forums, while others are in social networks like LinkedIn, Facebook and PrintJunkie. Are they creators of content? Joiners that maintain profiles? Spectators? Critics on forums and blogs? I would believe 57% ARE engaged, and wonder what % of them offer it aspart of their solution offering to their clients? I think that people in GA businnes don know e how to use in the best way social media to help their business, we as vendor could give them some ideas of Hi Lindsay I really interested in this subject and recently created a survey to ascertain what UK printers are doing, or intend to do re SM.

But I couldn resist putting together this post headline after reading , courtesy of . It shares some insights gleaned from this week CITE (Consumerization of IT in the Enterprise) Conference and E in San . Of particular interest to me, and the te from which I plucked the above acronyms, is this quote from the conference keynote speaker, Gary Hamel of the London Business School: want the power to make their own decisions, set their own schedules, work from wherever they can be comfortable, and BYOD [bring-your-own-device] helps free them to do that. amazing as it sounds, companies can get along without a hierarchical group of managers if the employees are self-motivated enough to do their work on their own volition. What we be seeing ne are concepts such as SYOG (set-your-own-goals), DYOJ (design-your-own-job) and AYOE (approve-your-own-e). It not that far-fetched. And then this, which relates directly to an I posted recently: when Tom Peters wrote the mega-bestseller the mid-1980s? Hamel said. focused much of the book on a great, creative company called HP. You know, HP Way, creating new $50 million businesses, the story of the garage, classic Silicon Valley. And HP was an innovator in those days. But then [CEO from 2005 to 2010] Mike Hurd, Mark Hurd his name? drove all the out of them. Also, according to the article, Hamel reflected on the day Steve Jobs introduced the iPad. three or four times during his presentation, he stopped and said: just so beautiful to hold! Can you imagine Mark Hurd standing up on stage with an HP product and saying: just so beautiful to hold! a chance. Companies have to keep reinventing themselves and their products. Based on those two key themes evolution and innovation will be interesting to see what other takeaways emerge from the CITE conference. Very interesting read, thanks for sharing. Thanks for reading and commenting, Ma!

After all, by the middle of December, few people are really thinking much about work. The chances of getting your customers to commit to a major contract are very slim. They allow for the fact that there won be many jobs coming in at this point. They also allow for the fact that there not much point in talking to customers apart from sending them Christmas cards and season greetings. But printing companies that think in this way are missing a trick. It true that workloads often light during this time of year. However, it still an important time to have business conversations with your customers. Here are three important things you should be talking to your customers about. If you do have light loadings at this time of year, it important to schedule efficiently. You may be able to schedule downtime or even cancel some shifts. However, you can only do this if you receive jobs when you need them. It a good idea to plan e calls to customers to make sure that they send jobs on time. You may be able to persuade customers to send some jobs early. this level of communication can make all the difference as to whether you can manage under-capacity effectively. However, it important to look beyond just the ne few weeks. Many of your customers will have already begun their 2015 planning. By now they should have some definite plans in place. Some may even have set budgets. This means that by now they should have a good idea as to how much work they could be sending your way ne year. This is the ideal time to ask your customers what their future plans are. Should you be allocating more capacity to their business? Or, in a less positive scenario, are they contracting? Should you be looking for a new client to make up for the fact that you will be receiving less work from your current customer? In either case, you will get some good insight on the work you will be receiving over the ne few months and can plan accordingly. I have always been surprised at how few printing companies carry out this practice. I would particularly recommend it for your larger, more valuable clients. There is another conversation that I often do not hear from printing companies. Some of your customers may not do everything in quite the way that you would wish! In some cases they may have good business reasons for this. Other companies simply work inefficiently through ignorance. Many are quite happy to change their ways if they understand the impact that it can have. This time of year can be a good opportunity to have this type of discussion with clients. Offer to help them set some New Year resolutions. In doing so, coach them on how you would like to work in the coming year. Many will be happy to respond positively to such a request. Start by setting up some December appointments with you key clients. Go through these three areas with them. You may be surprised at the benefits to your business. But do remember to schedule that well-earned break for yourself as well!

Because what some owners may not realize is that as much as . And on average, companies spend up to . Make an impact here and you be driving efficiencies that touch most corners of the business and save time and money. The typical process for transmitting invoices to accounts payable makes for a telling e. In small companies, it not uncommon for this process to be ad-hoc and inefficient in a number of different ways. All of which is acceptable when the company is small and the number of invoices and finance people are manageable. But when the company starts growing and the comple of more invoices and more people get thrown into the mix, the process brings changes to finance in non-trivial ways. For one thing, finance staff may spend an inordinate amount of time on manual, tedious tasks. But more importantly, a slow, deliberate process means the CFO has to wait longer to know how much the company owes. This simple document process has a direct impact on how much visibility the CFO has into cash flow. Growing business? Document management may be your secret to faster cash flow. In the case of the above e, there are a number of ways IT can drive efficiencies and savings for finance. There an immediate opportunity to use your multifunction printers and scanners to automate workflows for scanning, storing and sending invoices. There also a simple (though often overlooked) opportunity to secure documents by ensuring printers only release jobs using a PIN code. Of course, the real opportunity is actually bigger than just savings and efficiency, though obviously, those things matter. It also to help finance gain visibility into cash flow.

(Photo courtesy Georgetown University.) Having just sent my youngest son off to college his freshman year, I very recently re-engaged with what it feels like to begin life on campus. Today students have options and opportunities that our generations could not have imagined. And aside from never needing to set foot in Bed, Bath & Beyond again, this e reminded me how meaningful this campus really is. It represents endless opportunity, special traditions, life-long connections and friendships, e in time, and lessons learned. It helped shaped who I who we chose to become. My Georgetown journey began at Healy Hall and I thought it worth reviewing the story of Patrick Healy. Healy is most well-known as the first black president of Georgetown and he did so much for the university, he is thought of as our second founder. But his story is much deeper. Although the three Healy boys went through life identifying as Irish-American, the family hid its mi-race ancestry in order to provide opportunities that would not have been possible had the world known their true roots. Patrick Healy is now recognized as the first African American to earn a PhD; the first to become a Jesuit priest; and the first to be president of a predominantly white college. But when Healy background was made public in the 1950s, students defaced his portrait and 10 years passed before Georgetown even began admitting African Americans. The story of America first black to hold a PhD tells us how black lives matter. http:/ctt.ec/fbzU3+ The Healy family had to deny their very identities to achieve success. We may not have to go to the same lengths today, but Healy portrait reminds me that there is still work to be done. You and I are empowered to do it. That story speaks to the diversity that was the foundation of my higher education and yours a foundation that should e for all. Not just in backgrounds or skin color, but the diversity of ideas, connections and e that breeds the creative thought, the self-awareness and the enriched perspective that has become one of the most important gifts of the university e. But today, even the most disciplined of students, find the gift of higher education to be elusive. Average tuitions rose 440 percent in the past 25 years, outpacing inflation, and making college even less affordable to all. And let face it, when it comes to both affordability and attainment in higher education, most black Americans take off from a different starting line. Disparities in wealth, health, parental education, and even in course offerings and per-pupil investment continue to lay out a journey where blacks go without same educational opportunities as whites. a career of humanity, commit yourself to the noble struggle for equal rights. http:/ctt.ec/4bdUz+ We each made sacrifices and we also reaped the benefits of the sacrifices of those who went before us. Today we can help those who follow in our footsteps, do the same. Martin Luther King, Jr., quoted Georgetown University Professor Anthony Clark Arend in a speech to 26,000 African-American high school and college students on April 18, 1959. The students had come to Washington, D.C., to demonstrate their support for the 1954 Supreme Court decision in , outlawing racial segregation in public schools. said: a career of humanity, commit yourself to the noble struggle for equal rights. You will make a greater person of yourself, a greater nation of your country and a finer world to live in. That quote is etched in stone on the MLK Jr. Memorial in Washington, D.C., and I quite sure some form of it is etched in your hearts. We have the power to make lives matter by making sure they have an equal opportunity to learn and an opportunity to succeed. Research says only 16 percent of people are actually they intended to be when they grew up most likely because somewhere along the way someone taught them to think differently and look for opportunity in an une place. Many of us have professors, mentors, and e to thank for awakening our souls, making us reach for more, and positioning us for success. We have the power to help swing the pendulum close that endowment gap, and get the high-achieving, low-income students to this campus, where they can spread their wings and make Patrick Healy-like contributions to the world. Research shows that when low-income students attend top universities, they thrive. But the fact remains that many don attend due to financial constraints, even when they qualified and accepted to attend. It takes a special heart and a strong mind to understand that even the toughest of starts and the highest of hurdles in life make you more remarkable in the end. Journalist David Brooks describes two sets of virtues in a column called Moral Bucket List the resume virtues and the eulogy virtues. The resume ones are what you bring to your careers. The eulogy ones are what talked about at your funeral. Brooks puts the challenge this way: People on the road to inner light do not find their vocations by asking, what do I want from life? They ask, what is life asking of me? I believe that life does give back what you put into it. Many times over. So if our simple, yet collective actions on behalf of higher education inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, well, we certainly leave a legacy to be proud of. and receive email updates when we publish a new article. This article really resonated with me in light of the state of current affairs in our country and the world at large, particularly the Healys denying identity to achieve success. That is a very interesting and important aspect of history. a career of humanity, commit yourself to the noble struggle for equal rights. You will make a greater person of yourself, a greater nation of your country and a finer world to live in. Living in the Now and making a difference . . . I like that.

Fitbit spoke with Sarah to get her take on how she balancesa healthy lifestyle with being a busy mom.;What is the greatest impact Fitbit has had on your life as a mother?;: Fitbit has helped me in my journey to become a fit and healthy mother. In 2012 and 2013 I lost 18kg after being diagnosed with high cholesterol. High cholesterol comes with a risk of heart disease and stroke, and I knew I needed to make changes in my life. I got my diet under control and then started to e. I learned about the Fitbit Flex in 2013 and my husband surprised me with one for Christmas. I have now upgraded to a Fitbit Charge HR. My Fitbit helps keep me accountable and encourages me to get up and move as much as possible. We go for long walks as a family, have dance parties in the kitchen and I play with them at the park. They love having a more active Mum, and I love being able to keep up with them. They get e when they see it buzz at 10,000 steps, and often tap it to see my progress.;What made you start using Fitbit and what were your goals?;: I loved the idea of tracking my movements during the day to see how active I was being. I try to get to 10,000 steps a day, and if I go over its even better! After I lost weight my goals have been to maintain that loss and to become fitter. Now that I am using the Charge HR I love knowing that it reflects a more accurate picture of my calorie burn. I have participated in a few fun runs and walks which I hadnt done since I was a child. I initially chose Fitbit over other activity trackers for its ease of use and also its aesthetic. I decided to stick with the brand over others when they updated the features to include a heart rate monitor. The app is easy to use and gives a great picture of your day.;Why did you choose Fitbit Charge HR?;: I loved the fact that the Flex was worn on the wrist so I had a visual reminder to move throughout the day. When I first started my fitness journey I was primarily walking for e, but now I do more gym work and lots of High Impact Interval Training (HIIT) workouts. I had started looking at other fitness bands with built in heart rate monitors, and mentioned to my husband that I wished there was a Fitbit version. A couple of weeks later they made the announcement that the new range was being released. I waited, and recently got a Charge HR and I have had a lot of fun trying it out. It has been great for walks and spinning, and I am enjoying putting it through its paces during HIIT workouts and strength training.;How did Fitbit help you work towards those goals and overcome challenges?;: I find my Fitbit a fantastic reminder to get up and move. I am a teacher and my students are all interested in what my Fitbit does, and will ask me if I have done my 10,000 steps yet. I use walking around monitoring their work as an e to log more steps. Last year I took part in a charity walking challenge to raise money and awareness of the lack of clean water in African countries. My Fitbit was a fantastic help as it accurately tracked how much I moved. The Fitbit is so easy to use there are really no e. I recently sprained my ankle so was forced to rest, but once I was back on my feet strapping my Fitbit on reminded me that I could still move (within reason) and that my everyday walking counted towards something.;How have these changes impacted your life as a mother?;: I am fitter, healthier and happier. I can keep up with my children and join in when they play. There has been nothing but positive impacts that have come from being healthier. I started a blog, Style Unearthed, to share wardrobe, beauty, health and wellness tips and really enjoy writing for leisure. E also gives me me time, whether its a long walk followed by coffee with a friend, or time in the gym. I can also ensure I am getting a good nights sleep with the Charge HRs sleep function, which is so important when you have busy days. Being more aware of good food and e has also changed the way we eat at home, which also benefits the rest of my family. My son asks when he can have a Fitbit of his own, and wears a little pedometer so he can be like me and track his steps. The Fitbit has been an integral part in helping me stay fit and healthy, and keep the weight I worked hard to lose off.;Whats your advice for busy mothers who want to make a change?;: It can seem like such a mammoth task just to start becoming healthier. My advice would be to start small, and break your goals into achievable chunks. A Fitbit can really help as you can see how much you are currently moving and then you can decide what changes you want to make. You dont have to commit to train for a marathon to get fitter. Changing little things at a time, like increasing incidental e, can make a big impact. You could park your car at the far end of the car park, get off a stop before your usual one on the train or bus, or do laps of the oval while your kids are at sport training. Finding an e you really love also makes a big difference, and soon youll be addicted to endorphins and wont want to miss a day! I use the online program Daily Burn to mix up my workouts. It means I can e at home, and my children often join in. Using the Charge HR means that all of my e counts throughout the day. Carrying my daughter increases my heart rate, and therefore burns more calories. The Charge HR gives me e incentive to move faster or lift heavier things as I know they will increase my heart rate. As mothers, we often put others first, but its okay to prioritise your health and wellbeing too. If youre not in good health it makes it hard to look after your family.;What are your new goals for the future?;: My goal is to use my new Fitbit Charge HR to help me become even fitter. I would like to continue with gym and HIIT workouts in an attempt to build lean muscle and tone up. I also want to keep having fun with e, trying new workouts to keep things fresh and involving my family where I can. Life is too short not to have fun!; Comments your success story with Fitbit.

Make the effort to ask for the reasons. Julian Patel Start building relationships early. Get to know the decision makers; their buying processes and what they look for in their suppliers. With sufficient insight you can respond to their ne RFP much more effectively. There is no point pitching for business that you can deliver. So when a new RFP is issued take a long, dispassionate view of the requirements and ask yourself: It probably took your customer several weeks to write the Tender or RFP. Use it to precisely map your strengths to the specified requirements. Don include anything which is irrelevant. Don leave out anything which is important. Make a point of visiting the customer before you pitch. Not only does a site visit help to raise your profile and create or reaffirm the relationship, but it gives you an e opportunity to gain additional insight as to what might secure the business. Ask probing questions and listen carefully to the answers. Pay close attention to how things are said as well as what is said. Empathy and intuition can help you discover the customer real (perhaps unacknowledged) needs and pain points. The best relationships are founded on mutual success, so approach your prospect with this in mind. Think about how you can add value at every stage of the pitching process. Build desire. Even small benefits can add a lot of value. Try to work out who you likely to be competing with. Do you have a genuine competitive edge? If not, can you create one? Can you win on innovation? How can you defeat heavy discounters? Could you offer advantageous billing terms? Is leasing an option? Research your competitors. Use their web sites and social media to see how they operate and what they specialise in. If you understand their strengths and weaknesses you can identify areas where you can give yourself a competitive advantage. Reviews let you monitor and improve performance, as well as giving you a chance to identify new opportunities and build closer, multi-level relationships which help to lock out the competition. You won win every tender but you should be able to work out why you lost. Make the effort to ask for the reasons was it on price, offering or resources? Once you have the reply, consider how you could have improved your bid to win the business. Whatever happens, keep listening and learning. If you won, perform regular and honest reviews and do whatever you can to strengthen the relationship and keep the business. If you lost, adjust your strategy and keep the dialogue open, and keep in touch with the prospect just in case the winner doesn perform as e. Sometimes, the substitute wins the game.

In fact, these British businesses appear to be facing an uphill struggle to achieve GDPR compliance, with many left managing end users personal data across 24 different systems and a network of 48 other companies on average.;The research commissioned by ; UK and carried out by ; quizzed 500 IT decision-makers in companies with 250 or more employees across the UK to pinpoint the hidden obstacles still facing British businesses when it comes to ;. The research offers a snapshot of the e to which large UK businesses recognise ownership of customers personal data, how much personal data they are collecting and if they have plans in place to ensure compliance around this data.;Surveyed UK businesses are facing a major challenge to GDPR compliance: controlling huge amounts of data across disparate systems. According to the study, while the average large UK business now uses 24 systems to manage and store personal data, one in five (21 per cent) use over 40 systems to do so.;Additionally, almost half (47 per cent) of the respondents share personal data from customers with other businesses severely adding to data sprawl. On average, they share this data with 48 other businesses but nearly half (48 per cent) of businesses admitted to sharing this data with over 50 businesses. While the majority believe they retain complete control over this shared data, 15 per cent admit to losing at least a degree of control over data once it has been shared.;On average, large UK businesses that responded to the survey collect personal data from 577 individuals each day. However, more than one in four (26 per cent) large businesses collect personal data from over 1,000 individuals every 24 hours creating a huge influx of data to store and manage in the enterprise.;Over half (58 per cent) of the respondents admit to storing personal data for over a year, yet a quarter (25 per cent) end up storing personal data for over five years. Despite this, two fifths (40 per cent) of respondents admitted that not all the personal data stored is actually used by the business while almost one in ten (8 per cent) admit they never use any of the personal data they store.;Almost two thirds (65 per cent) of the firms surveyed store and manage personal data based on predictive analytics but, interestingly, businesses could not agree on who owned this data. Only a quarter (27 per cent) of businesses believe this data is owned by the customer while half (50 per cent) think it belongs to the organisation.;Understanding data ownership and accountability is one initial key step in the journey to GDPR compliance. So, perhaps unsurprisingly, almost two fifths (38 per cent) of respondents acknowledge that they are not ready for the GDPR, either admitting that current control access policies are insufficient to comply with the regulation or they have no idea whether they meet the regulations standards. In fact, just half (52 per cent) of the large UK businesses surveyed carry out data privacy impact assessments for all or most personal data stored by the enterprise an essential step to implementing policies which ensure data privacy.;The GDPR will do far more than strengthen data privacy rights. The regulation will set a high bar for responsibility and accountability and not one that every business will meet. While many British organisations are taking steps to achieve compliance in time for the May 2018 deadline, our research clearly reveals some significant obstacles, including uncontrolled data sprawl and lack of understanding around data ownership.;Ensuring data privacy processes and systems are in place from privacy by design to privacy by default requires an organisation to know e where their data is and who can access it. Yet many are losing sight of data, spread across multiple systems and shared with multiple partners, while also struggling to scale up to store and control the huge influx of personal customer data they receive today.;Businesses must recognise that more centralised application and data storage environments will make it easier to meet technical compliance goals. This centralisation can be achieved in various ways, from introducing unified access controls across on-premise and cloud services with single sign-on to rolling out centrally-managed virtual workspaces. However it is done, controlling data sprawl and recognising enterprise accountability around data privacy will be key to GDPR compliance.;At Citrix, our mission is to safeguard our customers apps and data.

Today digital age is more ubiquitous than ever; with increasingly interactive and unconventional formats, the desires of the consumer are ever-evolving. Evolving technologies in the A3 and A4 printer segment, digital printing, MPS and DMS have led to significant shifts, not only in design processes and prints, but also in the development of new modes of production, distribution and consumption, cost efficiency and sustainable printing. What e is that the country has taken a big leap forward in various digital technologies to meet the demand in domestic and international markets for innovative e in the field of consumerism. Transformation is inherent in the Xerox DNA. Since the days of the Xerox 914, the first successful commercial plain paper copier which in 1959 revolutionised the document-copying industry, Xerox has always looked at the future. Be it the document revolution in the digitised world to the ne great leap in document management, Xerox has always been at the forefront of transforming document technologies. Acquisition of ACS, now known as Xerox Services, a large diversified business process & ITO company, e our services offering further aligning to address market demands. Xerox today has evolved to become the world leading enterprise for business process and document management. However, printing technologies are still integral part of Xerox business and Xerox continues to be known for its printers and print capabilities with strong service support network across the country. As technology progressed, the company that brought printing to the masses is now working behind the scenes, digitising the paper. This brings us to the ne level in document technology. Globally, Xerox offers customised document management solutions, manage print environments and provide document processing, and with the acquisition of ACS, we now offer a full range of business process and IT outsourcing services. Services now account for more than 55 per cent of our revenues globally. This is Xerox transition and transformation to the back-office market leader. In India, it is a combination of document management services, innovative technology products and channel businesses that are driving growth and profitability for Xerox. Some of the emerging trends that Xerox foresees in the Indian market are customised printing, affordable printing solutions, optimised printing, document management services and 3D printing. 3D printing is a key consumer trend, which is picking up due to its capacity to service various industries and verticals. It is used across industries such as design, medicine and retail, to name a few. It might take some time before it could be commercialised, but then the speed of adoption and evolution could surprise us. Also, in this age of digitisation, enterprises are shifting their focus into document management services and it is slowly but steadily gaining ground at the enterprise level. Further, there are a lot of new trends emerging in the document management space itself, few of them being mobility, security, integration and the option of storing data in the cloud. Through document management services, the consumers can today access data from anywhere making it mobile and integrating all information in the digital form. Such services are also very secure in nature prompting its adoption in a large scale. Besides this, a noticeable trend would be consumer opting for one stop solutions, that is, one product doing most of their jobs rather than different set of printers for different jobs. The market in the West is at a different stage of evolution and our offerings in the West also include our IT & BPO services, which touch a much larger part of the population directly. There are some natural differences in the communication and the media mix that we use. However, a large part of the communication is similar, with some adaptation of media and creative to make it relevant to our market and our offerings here. Many elements of the media mix remain common social media, digital platforms, and CXO events being the primary vehicles. Digital medium is an e sensitive medium that requires robust processes as well as constant monitoring and real time response. Xerox has social and digital properties on a global scale, be it in Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, where the focus is to have e and meaningful conversations who visit them. India content is also uploaded in alignment to global processes and uploading methodologies. The digital medium serves as a great platform for us to reach out to a large audience and interact with them. With the entire world adopting digital practices, it is the best way to keep your audience informed and posted on the regular activities that is happening. Digital medium being an open platform also gives the consumer an opportunity to post their feedback and views on our products and services. The digital space has hence, become a very lucrative opportunity for organisations to give a personal touch to the brand name and be always in touch with the audience. It also gives you an opportunity to develop the company web capability as a significant source of revenue through online campaigns that leverage on web content and to increase internet leads and overall sales. .: +91 124- 33711069 Xerox India Limited Floor, Block-1, Vatika Business Park, -49, Sohna Road, -122018, Haryana, 2017 Xerox Corporation.

It the route to getting prospects interested in you in a lot of different situations. In my , I e what an elevator pitch was. I also e why elevator pitches are so important in the sales cycle. You were given a guide on how to create an engaging elevator pitch. Now it time to look at you should be using your elevator pitch. If you want to have a worthwhile call with a prospect, you have to grab their interest immediately. A good elevator pitch will engage a client. It will make them want to find out more about you and your company. It should be the starting point to a much longer conversation. At most networking events you will have to introduce yourself to a lot of people. They will also hear from a lot of other networkers. The right elevator pitch will make you more memorable than other people. It will ma your chances of networking success. (If you want the best results from networking, take a look at our recent blog series). If you are meeting with a prospect, chances are you have already spoken to them. So why should you use your elevator pitch again? It a great way to remind your prospect why they agreed to meet with you. You can also use the elevator pitch to frame questions that will build the conversation. For instance: part of this introduction was it that encouraged you to have this meeting with me? Elevator pitches can make very effective introductions to sales letters and e-mails. In fact, with a bit of e wording, they can form the full te for a short sales e-mail. Remember to add a call to action at the end. You may feel that an elevator pitch is a bit short for a brochure. I would agree with that. However, the core message of the elevator pitch is one that can be developed to create a compelling introduction to a brochure. You can then use the rest of the brochure space to develop this initial message. The home pages of websites often do little to grab a prospect attention. Consider developing a good elevator pitch as the basis for the homepage te. This will have a far greater effect than the normal dull te about the features and benefits of a company. Make sure you have a more creative visual than a picture of a press! I am often asked what I do. I normally use my elevator pitch as the basis of my reply. It can create interesting conversations, even if this is just in a social situation. Plus, it a great way to practice and refine your pitch! You may be surprised at how often a conversation like this can also lead to business. This list shows you how versatile an elevator pitch can be. However, it by no means a complete list of where an elevator pitch can be used. Feb 11, 2016 How about on the bus from the hotel to an industry conference? I been reminded more than once that, when I engaging the person ne to me in conversation, the bigger impact may be how that conversation impacts someone sitting in front of or behind us. The person sitting ne to you might not need what you offer, but someone within hearing range of you might! (And they listening, even if they pretend like they not!) Heidi what a gret idea! I will be practising this when I am at graph E! Thank you. That how we know all the DPHS readers. They all be talking LOUD on the bus! Fantastic we can have a moving networking event! I look ofrward to meeting you at Graph E! I agree with Matthew, what a wonderful idea, especially with Graph E in mind, Heidi! What about in a cab ride as well?

More than most corporate initiatives, green IT efforts just feel right. Pressure is mounting on businesses of all sizes to green up their IT, making a top priority for many business decision-makers in tough economic times. In their , research firm Quocirca found 52 percent of European businesses polled said that they feel strongly about maintaining their commitment to sustainability objectives. These businesses are finding that, in addition to being morally cool, environmental responsibility also reaps real financial benefits in the form of reduced waste, lower supplies costs and trimmed utility bills. It no surprise, then, that print solution providers are an to help their clients on the road to greener and more sustainable systems and processes. From assessments through device management and ongoing performance reviews,channel partners are leading the way to more eco-friendly printing options that can improve compliance and security and contribute to the bottom line. Channel partners can reduce waste & lowered supplies costs whilst profiting from green printing Channel partners should start calculating the client eco-posture and carbon footprint by detailing energy consumption, paper use and total supply costs associated with the printer fleet. Focus on identifying places where the client can reduce environmental impact with a balanced deployment of devices and management tools to decrease energy, paper and consumables use. With cars, it miles per gallon; with print hardware, the onus is on the channel partner to recommend products that meet a badge that indicates devices are up to 40 percent more energy-efficient than non-certified gear. Printers and multi-function printers that warm up quickly and feature sleep and toner-saving modes also put the squeeze on power bills. Combine these with print management tools that can route jobs to the most efficient device and watch the client energy use dwindle. MFPs are often most valuable for what they don print. With a capable MFP, users can scan, store and share documents digitally when appropriate. Switching paper-trails to digital with MFPs and associated workflow management tools is a great way to improve the client productivity and reduce their paper and consumables use. There two sides to every story and to every sheet of printer paper. Why not set the client devices to print on both sides by default? Also, enabling pull printing a security and confidentiality feature that requires a user PIN at the device can save reams of paper wasted on prints left sitting in output trays and reprints made for no good reason. There are two sides to every story and every sheet of paper, why not print on both sides by default? Of course you want the client to take advantage of programs that take back and reuse things like toner and print cartridges, but you also want to make sure the organization is dutiful about recycling its paper waste and is purchasing recycled or sustainably sourced consumables. A well-rounded bi-directional recycling strategy can lead to considerable environmental savings, particularly in terms of carbon emissions. Ultimately, you want to show the fruits of your labor to the client in a concise form that details how much your thoughtful and e delivered print services program is saving in overall supplies and energy consumption. Integrated reporting gives you a way to provide the client with visibility into the environmental impact of their print infrastructure, and it gives you a key tool for continuous improvement and attached sales.

One of the first steps on the path to a digital strategy involves using technology to better manage your organization content, whether paper-based or digital or both. For various reasons, some departments within an enterprise have a tougher time getting the content management tools they need. More productive, digital document workflow is one route to digital transformation (DX), but if your most document-intensive teams operate without digital workflow and content tools, that a disconnect. If these pockets of document inefficiency aren helped, they may hold up DX for the entire organization. The path to digital transformation just got easier for small companies, mid-sized businesses and enterprise departments. The is a new cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) application. Designed to bring Enterprise Content Management (ECM) to smaller organizations, platform puts ECM tools in the hands of workgroups and document-saturated departments and processes. Enterprise departments easily manage and organize their business content and set up business rules to automate and drive common processes. With this approach, organizations aren forced into a full-blown ECM system installation, when a smaller package will do. This cloud-based ECM significantly reduces the onboarding time to days from months. Most importantly, it highly scalable to meet changes in user numbers, storage space and specific process requirements. A department can configure and run this ECM platform on its own without professional services, and that makes it different. Xerox DocuShare Flex is designed for end-user consumption with its standardized functionality and minimal onboarding time. It reflects the trend towards more localized, subscription-based technical solutions, instead of monolithic enterprise applications. This ECM platform suits the department environment. Department managers and functional leaders would consider DocuShare Flex to manage content found in areas like: If you want to start with a particular department or document type, the system is lightweight but powerful enough to automate repetitive tasks involving common business documents. The cloud-based, intuitive design requires minimal ongoing IT support or training. It an e of fitting the power of a product directly into the business and not depending on IT to deliver it. Once employees receive their URL, they can start bringing process automation to content-heavy, repetitive tasks. Users can still connect to their line-of-business ERP and CRM applications, while custom documents support unique departmental needs. Teams can use the platform to manage their communal work. Employees categorize, store, organize and manage the business content lifecycle, with 24/7 access to individual and team content across desktops, browsers and mobile devices. A powerful full-te search engine quickly finds files in a secure cloud repository. This solves a tremendous problem. Employees, especially knowledge workers, waste a disturbing amount of time looking for information. Study after study confirms this. information workers spend over 11 hours a week dealing with document creation and management. that more than day a week is lost to searching for something. Think of how this impacts your business. Now imagine that problem going away. Path to digital workflow just got easier for small & mid-sized businesses & enterprise departments.

Although wireless wide area networks such as 3G or 4G are now available in most urban areas, Wi-Fi is still preferred in most cases due to wide support of all sort of devices and the fact that you can get free connection now in most public places, including bars/restaurants, airports, hotels, city centers, stadium etc. More importantly, most people now enjoy Wi-Fi at home and e the same e when they travel, leisure, work etc. It's fair to say that Wi-Fi has grown from being a niche technology used by companies in warehouses and other business environments to a commodity technology (available to almost everyone). ; So if Wi-Fi has now become commodity, does this mean that the same Wi-Fi technology that we use at home can be used in business environments as well? Not e. Even though we have standards for Wi-Fi products, which guarantee that an Access Point from vendor X works with a tablet from vendor Y, there are some important differences between products that are designed for personal use (or SOHO, Small Office / Home Office) and Enterprise Class solutions. While most people can imagine that a Wi-Fi network in a large hospital, university or retailer with hundreds of stores will have other requirements than the Wi-Fi you have at home, the differences may be less obvious for a Small or Medium Business (SMB). Especially when looking at the price of your little home router or AP, it may look attractive to buy the same products for your business. After all, it works at home, so why wouldn't it work at the office. Good question. Well, the answer is that at work (regardless the size of your business) you probably need an Enterprise Class solution. So then tell me what 'Enterprise Class' means, I hear you think. Basically it means that the solution is 'fit' for use in a professional business environment which then means it has specific features and options which supports your business better than a home or SOHO product.

In my I talked about companies like these. We discovered that these types of customers can be very costly to printing companies. Many printers do not realise the true cost implications clients like these have on their business. Sometimes it easy to spot a difficult customer from a mile away. Other times, customers hide beneath the radar. It may be that they are being looked after by one person in your company. This person can sometimes keep quiet about the fallout from this particular customer fearful to be responsible for losing their business. Every four to six months you should consider reviewing your clients. Are they still achieving what you want them to for your business? Are there any that you might wish to consider getting rid of? This may seem like a strange strategy. After all, many printing companies are desperately seeking new customers. Why would you consider of some of your e client base? However, it is important that your customers are profitable. If they are losing your business money than they are not the right clients for you. There are four main indicators that you should look at when reviewing your customer base: The most important factor to consider is whether they are making you a profit or not. It is worth keeping detailed records of all the e costs associated with your customers. Make sure that all staff knows to record: Your should record the actual profit of every job. Set your e costs against this profit figure to get a true idea of the actual margin you are making on a customer. There is one other factor that also needs to be taken into account when considering profitability: that time. It is also important to consider how much time it takes to service a client. How much time are you spending on a particular client? You should measure time spent in all departments: customer services, sales, estimating, studio and even despatch and accounts. If a client is demanding far more than the average time, consider the opportunity cost to your business. Naturally, some clients may be worth spending more time on. It all comes down to the size of the account. The ne thing to consider is the turnover of the account. You may wish to retain some difficult clients because they give you a large amount of work. You may need this volume (although you should always look at finding new, easier clients to replace the difficult ones). Interestingly, many of the most difficult clients actually have a very small turnover. You are unlikely to really miss them if you get rid of them. However, you should always bear the future in mind. You may wish to consider keeping a difficult client if there is potential for serious growth. Before you make a decision on this basis, remember to consider two things., is that potential there? Many sales people have high hopes of their clients that are not really realistic. It important to be honest here. Ne, think about what will happen if the client does grow substantially. Are you suitably staffed to deal with the e service that this will require? Do you really want the stress of dealing with a large client like this? By the end of this discussion you are likely to have one or two clients where you need to take action. But how do you go about firing a client? That what I will deal with in my ne piece.

Andy Hill Does your company have a website? if so, Do you update it regularly with helpful information? How so? Because B2B technology buyers no longer look for solutions in a phone book. They rarely call in response to an ad or flyer or something they saw at an event. Instead, they are more likely to do research online first before contacting you. Indeed, CEB 2012 found that, on average, they were 57% of the way to making a purchase decision before contacting a supplier. If most B2B buyers start their research with online search - will they find you? Today, people are even more reliant on the Internet for getting answers to questions; everything from where to find a good restaurant, to health concerns, to trivia that comes up in conversations. B2B buyers go online for the same reasons. To get quick, helpful answers to whatever challenge or problem they are currently tackling. They know how invaluable up-front research is to getting the best solution for their needs. According to a , B2B buyers rely on digital sources for product and solution research, here are the top five sources: This does not mean that traditional marketing and advertising no longer matters. It does mean, however, that a user-friendly, up-to-date website is vital, so you need to consider prioritizing investments accordingly.

It starts with search, and when it comes to search, Google gets . So perhaps today, the right answer is .com.

In plain English that means when a user enters can I reduce printing costs? Google and other search engines will find your site because you have helpful, informative content that answers that specific question. There are reputedly over 200 that Google takes into account when deciding which site to list first on the Search Engine Results Page a bewildering amount for anyone. However, by creating some basic to your site, you can help search engines find you. Here are the basics: Start with . Once you have signed up, anyone searching for your business name and address on Google will find your contact information, links to your site and, if you have them, reviews. Best of all it is 100% FREE! With respect to your website, there are many factors to take into account including making sure that is it mobile friendly, but consider this variation of a popular saying: Your website will never get a second chance to make a great first impression. No one will stick around for more than a few clicks if your site is hard to understand and use, so it critical that you have the pages and features that B2B buyers have come to e. If you haven assessed your website recently, and by I mean this month, there a good chance that you missing learning opportunities for improvement. 5 ways that vendors can help channel partners with their digital marketing Most channel partners have limited marketing resources, so getting this right can be a daunting task.

Recently, both the British Courts and HMRC have declared the processes they are putting in place to achieve this aim. Southwark Crown Court will this week start trials with jurors using tablets in place of lever-arch files of evidence. Judges reportedly are saying that the technology will save time, money and paperwork, and make the trial much easier to manage. The jurors will no longer have to search through several lever-arch files but simply view documents via tablet utilising the Wi-Fi being installed as part of a major IT investment. No doubt there will be a long learning curve for the British Courts to adopt and integrate this technology, but their aim, as with most organisations who wish to reduce their reliance on paper, is commendable. When the term paperless is used, most people envisage NO paper in the workplace at all, and all documents used, viewed and annotated electronically, yet we still believe this target to be far off in the future. However, technology has provided us with the ability to vastly reduce our reliance on paper. The old adage -Less seems to suit. Technology now allows us to reduce the amount of paper consumed and by doing so improve efficiency and document workflow, but it going to be some time before organisations will be able to throw away their old printers. What is happening though is that printers have become true multifunctional devices rather than a printer that can also perform other functions. Technology has moved forward to allow these devices to be not just scanners that convert paper into an electronic picture, but be the on-board for paper documents to create intelligent documents that integrate with digital workflow. Xerox have led the field in this area with their award winning ConnectKey software platform on their range on multifunctional devices that allow for the design and implementation of customised Apps (just like your smart phone). This brings two significant advantages. First, these bespoke Apps can be created to suit your organisation requirements and workflow, allowing true integration into backend systems. Secondly, (and some would say more importantly), is user adoption. Typically there is a long and painful learning curve when implementing new software and workflow. These apps are designed just like that on your smart phone whereby simplicity is key. In its basic form the user simply has to select the app and scan the document. Metadata and scanning requirements can be pre-programed for each type of application, freeing the end user of remembering (or incorrectly inputting) the correct procedure. We believe that these types of Apps will become commonplace, like they are on your smart phone, and will vastly accelerate our transition towards the -Less office environment. As for a paperless British Court system, we shall have to wait and see.

Concerns about printing costs rarely open the conversation. They should. With their minds typically focused on big picture goals like revenue and growth objectives, it easy for perceived small budget items to fall by the wayside. What few SMB owners realize is that printing and document management represent appro 15% of an SMB overall IT budget and accounts for at least 12% of IT resources . That by no means a small portion, and it is one that could significantly impact the budget for better or for worse. While initially it might seem like switching to 100% digital workflows is the fast track to efficiency and reduced spend, the reality is that 40% of business processes are still document-driven , and likely to remain so. Look around your office. Odds are paper plays a more important role than you may have realized. It also an opportunity you never imagined. Document Management is about more than just reduced cost printing. It about ensuring that information flows throughout your organization in a smooth, predictable, efficient way. It about making sure your team has what they need, when they need it, enabling a productive work environment, greater cost efficiency, and best of all, happy customers employees. 15% of your budget is going WHERE?! The surprising truth and how to make a change It may seem overwhelming, but the measure of your print environment can be broken down into three areas. To make sure you getting the most out of your print infrastructure, start by considering how information flows in your organization. Are there gaps that need to be filled?

No one has given you any advice on the route to take. You have no satellite navigation. Getting to your destination would be e tricky. It would certainly take you much longer than necessary to get there. In the worst-case scenario, you might even fail to arrive. It has got nothing to do with driving. But sales teams find it just as hard to achieve their targets without directions. If they aren given the right guidance the journey will be challenging. Owners and managers who give their sales teams the right guidance will help them achieve their targets. The company will be in control of the sales process. It will be much easier for the sales team to make good relationships with the right sort of customers. Sales teams that are not given guidance often waste time with the wrong type of customers. There is no control over the work that is sold by the company. Everyone is frustrated because people are rarely achieving what is needed. That why I have written the ne series of articles. Over the coming weeks, we are going to look at three key areas of sales. The first of these will be choosing and qualifying the right clients for your company. Ne we are going to focus on creating a compelling sales message that encourages prospects to buy from you. Finally, we are going to look at some strategies to ensure that your company is able to work to the best profit margins. In order for you to get the best out of these articles I am going to set three action points for you. Here the first one. This may be something that your company does already. However, many sales meetings focus on e the figures. They go over e what happened in the past month and what people hope will happen ne. What they do not look at is the best strategies for the sales team. Therefore, I would like you to set up some meetings specifically to look at sales strategy. It is important that these meetings do not focus on what individuals are doing right now. The meetings should encourage everyone to come to the table with ideas and to be honest about the challenges that they face. It difficult for people to be open in this way if they feel that their sales figures are being e. That doesn mean that the performance of sales teams should be ignored. We cover this with this ne action point. Many sales teams do not have their performance correctly measured. Yes, it is vital to look at the revenue being brought in by each salesperson. However, if performance is to be e correctly, a number of other targets should be set as well. It is important to review the actual activity of your team. Therefore, moving forward, it important to look at what each person is actually doing during their sales day. How many calls are they making? How many meetings are they setting? How many quotes are being converted? Are they carrying out any other activities such as networking or social media? Bear in mind that the activity plans for each person can be very different. They should focus on each person individual strengths. There one other thing I would like you to do. We be covering how to choose the right type of customer for your company. It the first step to sales success. Without focusing on this area it will be difficult to carry out other sales activity successfully. Think of it as the first step in your directions that allow your sales team to travel to the right results. you like more ideas on how to engage with today buyers, download my free e-book also receive my regular from the print buyer bulletin, full of ideas on how to sell print effectively.

You know it as Google Glass. is very e to speculate on the possibilities that this technology will allow. Matthew Shreve, Xerox researcher At Xerox, we are developing that compile information from these devices to help understand human behavior, and automate all sorts of processes. This area of research is advancing quickly as high-resolution, low-cost cameras and sensors proliferate, and the cost of storing video and other media drops. In general these supplement our eyes (and sometimes ears) with additional information. In the case of Google Glass, it provides a user with a virtual . Apps such as email or video recordings can be displayed in the monitor by either swiping the touch-sensitive frame, or by using voice commands. In contrast, another product called is a full-view AR headset that aims to bridge the gap between fully immersive virtual reality tools such as the and (relatively) more subtle wearable devices such as Google Glass. But back to the awkward grocery store trip. Instinctively, I wanted to remove and hide the glasses in my pocket within seconds of the first disapproving look from a fellow shopper. Instead, I managed to collect about 10 minutes of video data using the embedded camera on the front of the device. As a researcher (and an avid science-fiction reader), it is very e to speculate on the possibilities that this technology will allow. Will we use it to navigate through a city we have never been to? Looking through Glass, the building you are heading toward could be presented in false color and projected at scale through objects blocking your view, letting you see around corners. Or think about visiting a museum. Supplemental information about a painting you looking at can be presented alongside the real thing, making it easier to learn. How about when you forget someone name at a party and facial recognition software provides it to you? It is interesting to think that eventually, seeing these devices being used in public may be as common as seeing someone te on their smartphone. But considering that Bluetooth earpieces still get glances even after several years of being on the market, it should also be interesting to observe the colossal marketing job that will be required by companies like Google to make wearing a device like this socially acceptable. Thanks Matthew for this article. really fascinating how this technology is to change a simple daily routine e its implementation, definitely a new age will start.

In LMHA\'s case, Microsoft Azure Government was the deployment cloud of choice. ; As a result, LMHA staff are leveraging the cloud environment from ; in several ways using mobile devices that can work anywhere, are secure, and are device agnostic to benefit both employees and clients. For e, employees can bring their own device, and use a complete Windows desktop on any mobile device, including Apple products running iOS. That means staff can take their office to the field since they no longer need to complete physical paperwork, which hasa tangible impact for employees who can work more efficiently, and on the community who now receive services easier, faster and more simply. ; And it also means that clients now access apps and data from a device they are familiar with, 24 without having to come into an office location, which had often posed a hardship to some,` such as the elderly and disabled.

Although wireless wide area networks such as 3G or 4G are now available in most urban areas, Wi-Fi is still preferred in most cases due to wide support of all sort of devices and the fact that you can get free connection now in most public places, including bars/restaurants, airports, hotels, city centers, stadium etc. More importantly, most people now enjoy Wi-Fi at home and e the same e when they travel, leisure, work etc. It's fair to say that Wi-Fi has grown from being a niche technology used by companies in warehouses and other business environments to a commodity technology (available to almost everyone). ; So if Wi-Fi has now become commodity, does this mean that the same Wi-Fi technology that we use at home can be used in business environments as well? Not e. Even though we have standards for Wi-Fi products, which guarantee that an Access Point from vendor X works with a tablet from vendor Y, there are some important differences between products that are designed for personal use (or SOHO, Small Office / Home Office) and Enterprise Class solutions. While most people can imagine that a Wi-Fi network in a large hospital, university or retailer with hundreds of stores will have other requirements than the Wi-Fi you have at home, the differences may be less obvious for a Small or Medium Business (SMB). Especially when looking at the price of your little home router or AP, it may look attractive to buy the same products for your business. After all, it works at home, so why wouldn't it work at the office. Good question. Well, the answer is that at work (regardless the size of your business) you probably need an Enterprise Class solution. So then tell me what 'Enterprise Class' means, I hear you think. Basically it means that the solution is 'fit' for use in a professional business environment which then means it has specific features and options which supports your business better than a home or SOHO product. Let's take a look at some of these specific features and options. ; - Support for mobility:; Topics: ;, ; Posted by ; April 27, 2015 at 4:36 AM ; ;Its shocking to think that even by conservative estimates, the WLAN in most industrial environments is some three to five years behind that of the carpeted space.

The event went away for a while, but was revived in 2011 and is now held every three years, a fact we stumbled upon during a family visit to the mountain. We went into the gift shop and found discounted event shirts noting that we had missed the event by just days. We vowed to attend a future running of the event, and with Tim O announcing his plans to campaign a Focus RS up the mountain this year, RS Nation headed to Gorham, New Hampshire, to bear witness to Tim\'s efforts to campaign the only known Focus RS prepped for Hill Climb and Rally. Not sure who Tim O\'Neil is? Then you\'ve haven\'t spent time anywhere near Dalton, New Hampshire, where Tim bases his rally school. Tim, sometimes affectionately referred to as ""The Old Man of the Mountain,"" is a bit of a local legend and area celebrity. To enthusiasts, Tim is an accomplished rally driver who opened Team O\'Neil Rally School in an effort to instill those talents in aspiring rally drivers. For a time, he held the record for the fastest assent of Mt. Washington with a time of 7:45 set at the 2011 revival of the race. Tim is also known for his campaign of the first-ever all electric car at Climb To The Clouds. He bested his 2011 time and established the then-fastest electric assent of the mountain with a time of 7:28 in 2014. Tim is back at it again, this time taking a car that, while it displays the proud RS moniker (Rallye Sport), does so without ever having earned it. Tim has taken it upon himself on his own dime, and his own time, independent of Ford to take a bone-stock RS and prep it for hill climb and rally events to see if, in fact, the RS is worthy of that badge and all that heritage. The Mt. Washington Hill Climb was the inaugural event for this special RS with plans to run it at the New England Forest Rally later this summer. As noted, Team O\'s RS is the only known RS currently competing in hill climbs and rally anywhere in the world, and their development of the car has been insightful. Team O\'Neil has three RS racers in their stable: The fully prepped rally car, one blue RS rumored to have been the car that Ken Block drove in Dubai, and Tim\'s own Frozen White RS. If you are like us at RS Nation, you tend to fuss over your RS a bit. But being up-close-and-personal with Tim\'s RS puts any worries you might have about nicks, chips and scratches to rest. As you might e, Tim daily drives his RS hard. That car, a little worse for the wear due to Tim\'s renowned spirited driving style, is immediately recognizable by the e body modifications that Tim has made to it during the course of ownership, including a busted lower chin spoiler and a flapping rear bumper cover, both indicative of Tim\'s true love for the car. The Team O\'Neil rally car started out life as a stock RS that the team gutted of all creature comforts. The team then set about making all the necessary modifications to make the car eligible for the hill climb and ARA Rally competition. Immediately notable are the obligatory skid plate mounted up front and a new suspension; gone are the OEM shocks. The engine has been tuned by Mountune and is the same V3 tune that you as a mere mortal can purchase through Mountune. Tim says that as good as the car is, it now pulls like a freight train even though it\'s dialed back via a turbo restrictor plate. The car also sports an oil cooler to help keep engine temperatures down. What remains is the same AWD system that we enjoy in our factory cars. The team has been e the limits of the system and has developed some work-arounds that ensure the AWD stays engaged even during the tortures of the hill climb and rally racing. The amount of work and development that Team O\'Neil has put into the car in such a short amount of time is really remarkable. Through their development process they have been able to identify strengths and weaknesses of the platform for this kind of competition. Tim and his team have worked hard to convert the RS into a capable all-around performer. While Tim feels confident that the car is a beast on tarmac, he wonders aloud about its potential as a dirt car, as the mechanical requirements and needs for running on dirt are much more strenuous than they are for hill climb racing. Day One of qualifying had teams running the lower half of the mountain, which meant all tarmac. Team O\'Neil entered two cars into the event: one driven by Dave Savage (Fiesta R2) and another driven by Tim. While Time drove the RS, Dave\'s drove a rally prepped Fiesta R2. If you\'ve never driven the Mt. Washington auto road, it\'s something that must be e in person to be appreciated. When there\'s two-way traffic on the road, anything above 20 miles an hour can feel like you\'re taking your life into your hands. There are sheer dropoffs and no guardrails along the route. During competition on that same road, speeds can approach in e of 80 miles an hour! Tim\'s qualifying first ascent of the mountain went well, leaving him feeling confident in the car, but needing to find more courage as he attacked the course. Teammate Dave Savage didn\'t fare as well. During qualifying, Dave car found too much traction on the outside of a turn, causing his Fiesta to flip over ever so gracefully and wind up on its back, like a turtle, in a heavily spectated area. No worries; Dave pulled out a backup car and the team worked to ensure it was ready for the ne day competition and it was. On race day, the clouds parted and there could be no more perfect weather for the race. It\'s been known to be 90 degrees at the base and at the same time 40 degrees with no visibility at the 6,282-foot-high top of the mountain. By the end of the first run, Tim was in third place looking for the courage needed to take 16 seconds off his time. In the end, Tim would place Second in Class and 19th overall with a time of 7:20, or faster than he has ever run it before! Team O\'Neil will be entering the RS in the New England Forest Rally and RS Nation will once again be there to cheer them and their RS on as they continue to develop the car validate that it is indeed worthy of the RS badge.'",ford,11,58,236.11,0.3,-0.65,n,y,n,n,n,-0.0253116457,0.0154015726,-0.0227600605,-0.0538403406,-0.0349203127,6331,532,8.4030958774,73,y,n,y,y,n,2,5,3,1,4

This told the story of how successfully transformed into a services and solutions provider. One of their customers, from Verona in Italy, has kindly shared their e of implementing managed print services across their global organisation and the impact it has had on their business. It a familiar story that we hear from businesses large and small, across Europe and indeed the globe. Calculating your printing and document management costs is harder than it looks. Let alone how you optimize and automate document workflows across multiple countries and regions. That is why choosing a vendor and channel partner that is capable of conducting a thorough print assessment using , whilst providing a single integrated management platform was so critical to success. In this video, Francesco Lombardo, CIO of takes you through their e of implementing with Xerox Channel Partner, across multiple borders including Italy, Germany, Spain, Romania, Russia and Me. I have also included the transcript below the video. Gruppo Manni is based in Verona with 70 years e in the iron and steel sector. We are a holding company for 12 companies, with 21 production plants in Italy, Germany, Spain, Romania and, more recently, in Russia and Me. have around 1,000 employees and an annual turnover of around 500 million euros. We serve 10,000 clients in 60 countries across four continents. Our main problem was the need to have overall control of the domestic and international costs of document production. Part of our machine inventory was obsolete and in need of renewal, and it was certainly important for us to be able to increase the level of security in managing document production. There was virtually no monitoring of our printing before this project. We knew our print volume but we were not able to calculate precisely either the cost or the volume for individual offices or factories. We were initially very fragmented, managing around 18 brands within the group, 58 different device models and around 320 individual devices in total. How Xerox channel partner, Punto Doc helps an international client take control of their print Gruppo Manni saw great potential in the offer from Xerox since it offered us the chance to renew our company processes completely and optimise them, to create a significant saving on the volume and annual costs of printing and to optimise our machine stock by renewing it, thereby increasing its efficiency by using the latest technology available. The fundamental advantage of the Xerox offer is Managed Print Services, which make Punto Doc proposal completely innovative and different from the rest of the market. Normal, standard providers that don offer these possibilities can only provide a hardware management service which is inferior to the service offered by in every way. Thanks to the accounting solution, we succeeded in implementing significant security measures for our printing and our document production. The solution that we adopted ensures that our machine stock is e efficient, and overall the solution has allowed us to reduce our print production by 38%. Without the Xerox project, Gruppo Manni would have seen document production costs skyrocket. We wouldn have been able to manage document production in an organised and structured way, with complete control. Our partnership with has allowed Gruppo Manni to concentrate on the company core business and forget about all the tasks relating to document production which have low added value. It allows us to be competitive and fle when we opening new factories and planning and setting up new areas of business. Channel partner success story - managing print for an international client A fantastic e of how are delivering a superior service offering than their rivals. By leveraging the power of Xerox partner print services, they have been able to design a solution that solves Gruppo Manni document management challenge and scale it for their entire organisation across multiple borders using a single integrated management platform If you are a channel partner looking to solve print and document management challenges for your customers then we should talk.

The piece, which discusses the differences between selling your products and/or services with either a hunter mentality or that of a farmer, claims that a farming mentality is best for cultivating increased revenue through marketing. It no surprise then that the post author, who spent a great deal of time as a salesman, argues for the farmer-oriented approach to selling. From the piece: sales people are analogous to hunters. They stalk their in hopes of a that they can return back to the tribe as food (or more to the point, revenue). contrast, content marketers share the traits of farmers.

But it a discipline that requires patience and a great deal of consistency, as noted by the article author.

They can easily streamline workflows, quickly manage documents and even link back to your customers document repositories. These super powers not only ensure that your customers lives and businesses run more efficiently but also create fantastic opportunities for you, our Partners. In this blog, we show you some e of how you can unlock these capabilities within (PAB) to create applications that your customers (and your bottom line) are sure to love. They may even think you a superhero for creating them. Personalized Application Builder is a suite of tools that allows you to build personalized and customized solutions for your office, production and managed print service opportunities. By using these tools, you can deliver simple yet powerful workflows according to the way your customers work. Moreover, your ability to build upon your customers needs and turn that intimate knowledge into the perfect solution will set you far above the competition. Leap tall buildings or streamline workflows? Learn how to unlock MFP superpowers The sky is the limit. Your customers can eliminate e work and the possibility of errors by properly scanning records and immediately storing them into a searchable database. Consider how the same Image button can be used for different customers. A law firm may require legal documents to be scanned at a higher resolution whereas a business wanting to preserve server space may require images to be saved at a lower DPI. This functionality can be built directly into each customer Image button, ensuring simplicity for the end user. You can create custom user interaction capabilities such as an or buttons on the multifunction printer touch screen. These features will allow customers to simultaneously send an invoice or e to the right department and archive the information in a document management system for easy retrieval. To the end user, a simple push of a button, in turn, kicks off an entire workflow behind the scenes. You can enable personalized support opportunities that help you stay one step ahead of your customers needs. For e, you can create an Need Some Supplies button. The ease of reordering will directly improve customer satisfaction, not to mention help drive revenue streams. Develop menus and language that are meaningful to your customers. If your customers refer to scanning as upload, make sure to create an button rather than a button. You can also create customized tasks, such as & print from a document repository or to claims department. By talking like a local, it reinforces that you are in touch with their needs and committed to meeting their unique business requirements. MPS APIs allow you to e service / support information directly from the MPS hosted suite and import directly into your own system. By getting the information sooner, you can respond faster to customer needs and feed that information directly through to the end user. For e, you can add a Ticket Status message to the multifunction printer touch screen when a printer is down, eliminating the need for multiple calls for support. 5 Ways Xerox Channel Partners can unlock MFP superpowers and become customer heroes These e are just the tip of the iceberg of what you can offer your customers. Best of all, the capabilities within PAB are now available for you to either build yourself or for someone else to build for you with our newly developed Xerox Developer Partners Program. You will be able to engage this community and pay for an application to be developed on your behalf.

They know every inch of their course. They know e how they will react to potential scenarios. One of the most important things they will have researched is their competition. In , covered: This leaves one unanswered question: How do you research your competition? Most people start by looking their websites. That certainly a useful starting point. However, many company websites leave a lot to be desired! Here are three more useful routes to use. Social media is a great way to find out a lot more about other companies. The best platform to use is LinkedIn. Twitter and Facebook can also be useful. There are two ways to use social media. The first is to use it for basic company information. Many companies talk about themselves in more detail on social media than they do on their website or in their brochure. Companies will often have blogs, videos and posts about projects that they are currently working on. You may also be able to download case studies or white papers through social media. Don restrict your search to the company. Look at the social media profiles for their key personnel as well. They can be very revealing. The second way to use social media is to look at the conversations they are having. Who are they talking to on social media? Who is following their company page on LinkedIn? Who are key personnel connected to? Who likes or engages with the content that the company posts? On Twitter and Facebook the conversations are often even more open, and you can follow e what they are saying and to whom. In addition, think about signing up for any webinars or other online content that a company offers. There another very powerful way to find out more about a company. The point of this activity is not just to try and win new business although that can be a very welcome additional benefit! The reason for opening this dialogue is because customers can be very open about their suppliers. This applies particularly when they do not know that you know who their current supplier is! It is therefore very easy to ask open questions such as: A dialogue such as this is a great way to start constructing a sales offering based on e what key prospects want. Naturally, you should be having the same conversation with you own customers. You won be able to get in front of all your competitors customers. So here an alternative tactic. Companies are often proud about what they do. They are prepared to be open about what they have achieved and how they have achieved it. They may well be prepared to tell you an awful lot about their business. At this point, the dialogue shouldn just be about finding out information. You may discover ways in which you can work together. I have even had my competitors recommending me to their customers. You should be preparing to the same standards as a top sports person.

It not a new technology, in fact, it has been around for more than 3,000 years. Have I spiked your curiosity? Are you getting e at the thought of sharing this news with your colleagues? The technology is called paper. It is readily available and very affordable. To prove it, I have enclosed a blank, unprinted sheet in this letter for you to see. Hold it in your hand and imagine that this sheet makes people move, makes people take action. Best of all, this sheet can easily be delivered to the front door of any of your customers and prospects. And guess what? If your message is intriguing and the receiver is impressed, they will open the envelop! Your message cannot be swiped away with the flick of a finger, it does not run the risk of getting filtered into a spam folder before its even seen, and it is not competing with tiny pop-up advertisements that must be minimized with even tinier icons. The worst case is your message ends up in the big round archive. This is not unlike most of the unappealing junk emails you receive which are trashed or flagged as spam. Ah, but with mobile devices, your message is instantly delivered to the pocket of your recipient, you argue? While that may be true, I know for me it sometimes impossible to fully pay attention to all the notifications and new inbox messages that flash on my iPhone. But print and paper will always be opened if designed to meet the requirements of the recipient. Why? The Internet is crowded. It is sometimes like a traffic jam. The traditional postbox has become empty. This has never been more true. Here in Holland I receive less than 7 pieces of mail per week. The good news is, if you send me something on paper that captures my attention, I will definitely open it. Do you see a traffic jam in the mailbox? No. This means there is an opportunity. Think about this equation for a moment: paper + correct message + empty mailbox = BINGO. And yes, you can add components like the Internet, Augmented Reality and more to paper. The key message is: it is easier to drive customers from paper to the Internet rather than vice versa. Think again of that traffic jam What about sustainability. Is it green, you ask? Have you ever to tried to bury your smartphone or iPad? Of course not, because as you know that is not very green. Think about this: paper is the only medium with a one-time carbon footprint other media require energy they are viewed. mills have been recycling paper for many years. Ask a paper mill for a free tour and they would be happy to oblige. They are e proud to tell you how green their product is. Ask one of the biggest high-tech electronics manufacturers for a free tour of their factory and you might get a different response. As I said at the onset, print and paper are readily available, very affordable and delivers proven results. Welcome to my green world!

Love it! totally agree, amazingly we get print companies asking us if they can email their brochure to us I say, you can but I will not be looking at it if you do, send me something I can touch! Hi Steven, Thanks for your reaction. This is weird: print companies asking to send their brochure by mail? It is the same like working at a butcher as a vegetarian. Does not fit:-) the past I was always sending a printed image of a pie to potentials customer. After ringing the reception, everybody started to search for the cake. When i got the right person he complained to me: why are you sending me a printed one? It is not fair? what will bring you a real one! Can we make an appointment?

It time for service providers to listen, learn and take advantage of mobile technologies. That was how Barb Pellow, Infotrends Group Director, kicked off the 2015 Xerox Business Development Webinar Series, Pellow led the session, joined by two print and marketing services providers, Mark Serbin, president, , Sarasota, Fla., and Jeroen van Druenen, director, , Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Mobile devices have become the primary means for linking the digital and physical worlds, Pellow said, and mobile activators as mobile barcodes, near field communications (NFC) tags and augmented reality (AR) additional value to print. That value includes 100-percent trackable results for mobile campaign components and higher response rates. Pellow cited a recent study, which found that print marketing campaign results increased by 27 percent when the Web or email were added, by 37 percent when both were added, and by 45 percent when mobile was added to that. Here are e from Pellow interactive discussion with the two marketing services providers. : We see continued proof that integrated campaigns with mobile and cross channel communication give our customers better ROI and response rates. That makes them happy us happy it feeds on itself. : It closes the gap between online and offline, and makes print more relevant, and it happening right now. You need to have mobile capabilities. : It all variable data work, so we got more involved and had more training in all has to offer, such as QR Codes and maps. We have four full-time graphic artists who are e capable in InDesign, a mail department that does most of our data work, and one person who runs our digital department and maps the data to pre-press so it all comes together. We in a learning stage, learning to present better solutions to our customers. : It starts with people who enjoy their work and are interested in what they can do with the new technologies like personalized navigation. You need to give your staff time to deep dive into the programs so they can e and find fun and interesting things. And you want your sales team to ask them, can we do this, can do that? Then they work together to develop solutions, which is a key factor for success. : You need to have video skills, and we don. We buy them, and they are too e for a normal direct marketing piece. But if the offer has large volume or value potential, it can make sense. : We use te messaging and would love to use What App and messaging from Facebook. These are impressive e channels you can use to get to the customer. : To the top in our marketplace, really and truly. It separating us from other commercial printers. you are a service provider today, change isn going away, it accelerating, Pellow concluded. about getting that customer into a conversation, not just a campaign not one media or another type, but synergistically using that media, and its about real-time, now communications in a world where every customer is tuned in and turned on a with mobile device.

I definitely would say that for any business that uses the internet to continue to be successful, they need to appeal to people who browse the web on mobile devices. More and more people are using the internet that way, so getting things to be mobile-friendly is a huge asset. Thanks for sharing your insight on this! Thank you, Deepak and Jordan, I glad you both found the article helpful. If you interested, the webinar is chalk-full of other great insights from Mark, Jeroen, and InfoTrends and can be accessed for free from the green icon above. Bill (Xerox) Great article, insight and forward thinking by Xerox, all print machine manufacturers & printers should be seeing the potential in re-purposing the Print PDF file for other media channels and opportunities, Interactive Print, Augmented reality and actual Digital Online and App Editions of the printed publications. By incorporating the required software alongside the print machine supply the Printer can provide a 1 shop facility and clients benefit from a single supplier, Print and Digital working together is far more powerful than alone or against each other.

Here is the video interview and you can read the transcript below the video. We been talking a lot about your success with MPS (Managed Print Services) over the last few years. Give me a little idea about some of the things that you done to win these large opportunities. Okay, so we recognized that we had to figure out, what is our niche? What can we pick up as a tactical or strategic advantage over our competition? To boil it down, in a nutshell, the secret sauce for us was recognizing that we had to help customers optimize their environments. We walked into so many situations where we see customers with too much equipment, big A3 devices, and while we are happy to provide those devices, we know that in many cases the customers don need to have nearly the A3 footprint that they have. The other key was convincing customers to do what we call an open strategy approach to evaluating their environment. Don go out and ask three or four vendors to me a price for 50 of these, 50 of those, but rather, our environment and come back with your recommendations. We banked on the fact that our large competitors and large OEMs would go in for a like-for-like strategy to try to just replace large A3 with other large A3 devices. In the large wins that we had, we were able to show the clients how to reduce their A3 footprint by 60-70 percent if not more. So that has been the secret to our success. Xerox Channel Partner, Parmetech discusses leveraging Managed Print as a strategic advantage So saving them money essentially, but that not where your engagement stopped with them, you had some value-add to that (on top of the box) right? Correct. For many of our clients, their e with us was their first e in true MPS to manage their whole environment. So we wanted to show them that they could do things beyond just having the cost per page and fleet management. We showed them software solutions such as and which would enable them to really manage their cost by users, figure out what people were printing, how to drive print policies that could reduce the amount of printing that they are doing. Smart printing? E. In other cases, we asked clients sort of problems are you having? How can we help you solve a problem? And, for a large retail manufacturer we helped them solve a printing problem where they needed to customize forms for their large retailers that they were shipping product for. They wanted custom invoices and we showed them a solution that made that very easy to do, enabling them to e their e-commerce market. With Managed Print you can go beyond a like-for-like printer replacement strategy So now that you implemented some of these solutions do you find that you have a stronger, tighter relationship, better stickiness with those customers? What we found with our best customers that first showed the trust in us to evaluate their environment and select us; they are coming back to us with more [inquiries]. else can you help us? they are actually asking us the questions. So along the document management continuum where we start with the image on paper we say to them we can go any direction you want to. If you want to go to retention of older document versus optimizing future workflows to a digital format we can take it both ways. Sounds like you can solve their problems unless you are asking the right questions and it sounds like you asked them a lot of questions. Well, I really appreciate you joining us today, thanks for the insight and keep up the good work. Thankyou.

You not alone. Not by a long shot. In an , nearly half the respondents reported that their basic business processes rely on some kind of paper documents or digital unstructured data. Over half said their business data was stored in these formats. They also identified problems that went along with that: Digitizing the flood of information helps resolve some of these issues, but where do you start with document digitization? You can go wrong by looking at your processes. Digital transformation relates to our everyday work processes as much as it does to the ne big technology disruptor. The office of the future will be a digital office powered by digital processes. It in the day-to-day work where transformation pays off for traditional companies in terms of customer satisfaction, employee productivity, competitive advantage and reduced costs. The opportunity to improve operational e, for most organizations, can be tied directly to the ability to transition from paper-based to digital ways of working. This transition is often connected to scanning. At some point in your move to the digital office and digital future, scanning will be on the table. There has been some good thinking on this topic already. Document management e Kevin Craine describes the five stages of scanning in his on the topic. He defines the five phases of capture, various risks and opportunities associated with each, and suggests questions to help you to decide when ne phase makes sense for your organization. Here an overview of the five stages, according to Craine: Entry level of the continuum. Scan paper documents and store them in digital form. Also known as . Technologies like Optical Character Recognition (OCR) read data from document images and automatically populate index fields or zones. Things like PO numbers, amounts, dates or claim numbers are e of Phase 2 captured data. Many capture systems with zonal OCR require document templates built by programmers, which may incur additional e and effort to enter this stage at scale. Advanced data e moves beyond structured documents to handle more source types. Document management systems go from basic index information to e of multiple fields and line item detail. Fle, intelligent systems pull more detailed content from documents where data locations may not be known in advance, such as ad hoc invoices or healthcare documents. That information gets sent to backend databases and applications. Intelligent data recognition might read handwriting, map fields, and leverage advanced data codes and glyphs. This phase introduces different capture devices at point of entry, like MFPs, tablets and smartphones. Devices with capture capabilities let employees in branches and other locations capture and enter information into a system directly, rather than shipping it to a central location for processing. According to a 2014 AIIM study, 45 percent of companies feel that mobile capture is important for improved process agility and customer service. One constraint for Phase 4 is tying up knowledge workers to do the work of a centralized processing facility. vision is one where all documents are captured, digitized and stored with the least amount of manual labor, Craine. The capture system accepts documents in any format, including paper via scanners, fax or MFPs; desktop documents; email, data streams; and from mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. If your enterprise is serious about Digital Transformation, you got a lot of work to do, but half the battle is knowing where to start. The message is clear: start with capturing your documents and digitizing their data, and you be well on your way to digital processes, digital offices and the transformed future.

Xerox channel partner, has used this insight to their advantage and is selling more printers and MFPs by utilizing their print assessment e to create a clever way for their customers to support local charities, be more environmentally friendly and save money at the same time. I spoke to founder to learn more about , the innovative print and copy CSR initiative, that Stephen thinks can change the world, one printed page at a time. Stephen has always been charitable, but when his mother was at the end of her journey with cancer and residing at a hospice run by , the charity which supports people living with a terminal illness and their families, his desire to give back amplified. Marie Curie dedication to providing a caring and supportive atmosphere for people spending their last few days alive inspired him to find a way to help other businesses support a charity close to their hearts. How Xerox channel partner Document XL are saving their customers money whilst helping charities After researching the best corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs, Stephen wanted his program to raise money without the customer having to do anything more than going about a typical workday. As Stephen e, say simple things are usually the best and is very straightforward every time a participating company makes a print, a penny of that charge goes to their nominated charity. The process begins with a free 30 90 day print health check using industry-leading MPS e and advanced analytics from Xerox and NewField IT. also include a formal audit of the prospect current lease costs. a way to show where money can be saved and we don charge for this, says Stephen. found that clients are happy to give some of the initial savings to a charity, which creates an immediate win for the non-profit as a direct result of the assessment. The program leaves everyone with good feelings and makes it simple by managing the accounting and fund transfers to the charity. Customers are using the story in their own marketing through blogging and social media to brag about the charity they support. printers have benefits beyond fundraising too. For e, Stephen uses the Xerox ColorQube printers, which are environmentally friendly. Using ColorQube printers makes it easier to satisfy CSR managers because they can support a non-profit, save money on print, and reduce their carbon footprint. One of the challenges non-profits face, especially smaller ones, is how to create recurring donations. Charity Wrap gives them one more way to do this when speaking to businesses about funding options. As Stephen pointed out, the snowball effect. If you get one little desktop printer that produces 100 pages a week, it not going to generate much revenue. When you encourage larger companies to invest in the Charity Wrap printers, you generate more pages. The more machines charities have out there, the more recurring income they generate. How to support a non-profit, save money on print AND reduce your carbon footprint When you compare the time spent managing the Charity Wrap program to the benefits then it time well spent. Customers take meter reads and the Document XL accountant sends invoices every three months. Document XL tallies the charity portion, pays the charity, and an invoice is sent to the participating customer so that they can track the transaction. Document XL uses to connect with charitable organizations and CSR managers to e the program. The program has opened doors to new business relationships with other companies doing similar work. As Stephen says, is nothing like it and we even talking with a phone company who is doing a similar thing about striking up a synergy. So as each finds new customers, we can work together to generate more business opportunities for ourselves and the charities through print and telecom. Sometimes the timing just isn right for a prospect. As Stephen points out companies have multi-year lease contracts that have to be fulfilled before making a change we had meetings with large businesses that love the idea but have 50 printers on contract with another three years before they can make a change. Stephen looks at this as a nurturing opportunity this happens we remain in contact with them so that we can build a pipeline of conversations and prospects for the future. That how Document XL wins in the long run. If you interested in finding out more, visit the to see how easy it is to fundraise and win more business.

For a number of reasons, the time for digital transformation is now. And, one of the most important reasons comes from your customers. It doesn matter what industry you are in, the digital customer e is rapidly becoming the e and the norm. Whether you work in financial services, retail, healthcare, manufacturing, government, education or some other field, your customers are growing more intolerant of manual, paper-based forms and processes that slow them and you down. They e that your service and access to their information be automated, electronic, mobile and secure. E continue to rise, in part because some companies do a very good job of digitizing how they work, setting the bar for everyone else. When companies lag behind the benchmark, it a big disappointment to the growing community of customers, employees and partners who live and work in a digital world. make their choice by moving on to someone who gets it. Here an e from my own e as a digital-ready customer. Attempting to open a new account at my current bank, I was instructed to print out a form, complete it and physically bring it into a branch for processing. That bank lost my business. Instead, I went to another financial firm, where I was able to handle everything online, and my new account was open that night. The bank or any other business that understands the digital customer is a real opportunity to grow revenue has a considerable advantage, especially while their competitors still struggle to provide digital engagements and e. Who wants to be a laggard? The time is now. If you put off your digital journey, you put customer loyalty at risk. Increasingly, customers will seek out companies that provide a rich, digital e. Meeting e of the digital customer gets easier when companies have a good MPS foundation in place. If your organization has implemented MPS, here some good news. You already have an optimized, secure and well-managed platform for workflow-oriented innovation. Why not take it to the ne level and make use of the powerful platforms and analytics that should be delivered with every MPS engagement. No industry is immune. Everything and anything can go digital music, movies, books, watches, photos, appliances, even our homes and cars. Every paper-based process will also go digital. The question is, does it happen you, or do you happen, and make your company more successful and competitive?

b'https://digitalprinting.blogs.xerox.com/2014/02/18/why-micro-sites-are-an-important-sales-tool-for-printing-companies-2/',2,3,79.923,3,102.22,1,8,18,836,31,2,"b' Which shopping e are you more likely to go for? Would you go to a specialist home audio retailer, where you can receive knowledgeable advice and listen to different types of equipment? Or would you pick up a sound system from your local supermarket? If you have a true interest in music, chances are that you will go to the specialist hi-fi merchant. You will probably ignore a general retailer. This is a lesson worth thinking about when it comes to websites. If you want to attract highly segmented target markets (who generally spend more), you need to provide them with a specialised environment. It is going to be difficult for you to do this with your general company website. That why you need to consider the idea of micro-sites. A micro site is a small website. Typically, it will only have two or three pages. This means that it can be set up with minimal resources and cost. Micro-sites are often used to capture the attention of smaller audiences and drive them into a larger marketing funnel. They can also be used to test specific sales and marketing strategies. They are rarely used by printing companies. However, they can be a very useful sales resource. Here are three reasons why printing companies should consider using micro-sites. A micro site will have its own URL. So with the right domain name and the right content it can be highly attractive to potential customers. Customers are often looking for ideas that are very specific to their market. So they are more likely to visit a micro-site that is targeted at them than a general printing website. There is another reason why these will be appealing to prospects. A typical print website will need to have at least some information about the company and machinery. A micro-site doesn have to have any of this. The site is not about your company: it is about generating prospect details. Therefore, it is important to make sure there is a mechanism for capturing customer details. Typically, this will be in the form of a download of useful information. Another advantage of this is that you now are able to segregate your prospects according to their interests. You can create marketing and sales pitches that are specifically aimed at their markets and needs. The fact that you are generating prospect leads also points to another reason why micro-sites are useful. Because setting up a micro-site involves so little resources, it is easy to test new ideas. You can see e how much response varies to potential products or services for specific industries. As you are generating specific prospect leads, you are able to measure success very easily. there is no take-up on your idea, you have wasted very little.

However, there has been a groundswell of investment and commitment from key players that is changing the landscape. If you haven been paying (serious) attention, it time to start. AR is set to become the new marketing reality the way the other digital technologies like mobile and social media marketing have done. For those deeply already invested in the world of AR, that tidal shift is long past. For those with the lu of jumping into marketing trends a little later, such as commercial printers, we on the cusp. Here are three things you need to know about AR right now. I recently interviewed MJ Anderson, former co-owner and chief marketing officer for Trekk, a Rockford, IL-based agency with deep e in AR and VR, and now chief e officer for RealityBLU, a start-up rolling out a full-scale cloud-based AR platform, BLUairspace. BLUairspace is being rolled out in stages starting this summer and will serve the enterprise and industrial scale needs of creating AR and VR e. MJ and I spent a long time talking about the market changes related to AR and why a product like this is needed now. As part of this discussion, we talked about all of the AR applications and strategies that have been developed and are being developed by major brands. AR is set to become the new marketing reality. Here are 3 things you need to know today. While many of us think of AR applications in the conte of hokey games on the back of food packaging, that not what MJ is talking about. He talking about major investments in AR as a problem solving tool and for delivering useful information. E include retailers using AR to deliver loyalty program information, banks using AR to engage customers with video bank statements, and cable providers offering AR tutorials to help customers install their own cable bo. On the marketing side, Trekk is working with a large e promoter delivering ongoing AR e via direct mail containing a Google Cardboard. These aren gimmicky, throwaway applications. These are applications central to the way these companies engage with customers. This is a tidal shift in the way brands are engaging with consumers. The gaming community is highly influential in launching new technologies into the marketplace. Pok Go, which launched in July 2016, was a turning point in the gaming world and brought AR to the mainstream. Here are some eye-opening stats for the app: I haven been able to find similar stats for iOS, but CNET reported that was downloaded more times in its first week than any other app in history. So you get the point. Pok Go broke through the nerd wall and brought AR to the mainstream. As reported by eMarketer, a June 2016 CB Insights report that tracks the investment in VR and AR found that, even before Pok Go, gaming companies were making massive upgrades in their investment in the technology. Investment rose from $238 million in Q4 2015 to $1.1 billion in Q1 2016. eMarketer also reports on a UBM Game Network report that found that, while only 7% of gaming industry professionals were developing VR or AR games in 2014, nearly 20% were developing AR in 2015. That development hasn slowed. According to the Game Developers Conference 2017 State of the Gaming Industry Report, 13% of attendees said that their last completed game was released on VR headsets, a jump from 6% one year earlier. Looking ahead, 23% plan to release their ne game on a VR headset. One in 10 are working on a platform-e game for VR or AR.

This in turn has led to declining revenue streams for publication printers. The old saying you can beat them, join them now applies to publication printers who are adding digital publishing solutions to their offerings. New digital publishing solutions enable printers and marketing service providers to offer a complete publishing solution, add new revenues, differentiate and become more with customers. The first digital publishing solution was the PDF. Still quite popular today due to simplicity and low costs, PDFs are used by companies to provide electronic versions of magazines, newsletters, sales collateral, spec sheets, etc. While reading a PDF on a PC is viable; reading PDFs on tablets and smartphones often is cumbersome as the content is not formatted for the device. Nor is it easy to augment a PDF with video. New solutions on the market, such as Xerox FreeFlow Digital Publisher,are providing a super easy way for print service providers to simultaneously format content for print, PCs, tablets, and smartphones. Users can view content through their browser or via a custom app. And online content can be augmented with additional content. New digital publishing solutions enable printers to offer a complete publishing solution. Recently I had the chance to speak to a couple of service providers, The QMC Group and Millenium Marketing Solutions to learn more about how they are leveraging digital publishing for their business. a mid-size commercial printer with 55 employees in central New York. Their story is not uncommon for successful print service providers. The core of their business is offset printing and they are a certified G7 master printer. In order to grow their business they needed to find ways to augment offset printing revenues. They have added fulfillment services, custom storefronts, multi-channel marketing and now digital publishing. Travis Thayer is the resident Digital Publishing guru at QMC. Travis told me that they have a large number of customers for whom they print magazines and other publications. Adding digital publishing provides QMC with a new revenue stream and a complete solution for customers, helps them differentiate from other printers, and it helps them sell more print. QMC main target market is the higher education vertical as there are a large number of colleges and universities in New York State and QMC prints for a number of them already. By doing a little research Travis was quickly able to identify which of their current customers would be good candidates for their offering. A nice success story is the Cornell School of Engineering, which uses the solution for their alumni publication. Now alumni can easily access the publication via their tablets and smartphones. New solutions help printers shift towards delivery via digital and online channels. In Maryland, Janice Tipplett, owner of Millennium Marketing is offering digital publishing services as well. As a marketing service provider, Janice sees the interest of her clients growing in online, social and mobile channels and digital publishing gives her a way to stand out in this field. primarily in the B2B world. Their first success with digital publishing is a magazine titled . It a monthly magazine/newspaper covering Howard County, BWI Business District, and Northern Anne Arundel County. In addition to being able to view the publication in the correct format via a browser, Millennium uses Xerox FreeFlow Digital Publisher to create an App that users can download. The App provides additional advertising revenue opportunities as well as enhanced convenience for the user. Both Travis and Janice have indicated clients love the analytics features of the product which provides detailed usage stats, something not available in print. PODi is e to have both Travis and Janice sharing their e and advice in an upcoming webinar to help members learn about the digital publishing opportunity. You learn about why adding digital publishing makes sense for them, how they see their target markets, top applications, what they learned about what it takes to make sales and tips for newcomers.

This means your document will not be sitting around for everyone to see, or potentially get stacked in with someone else print job and spirited away to the wrong location. The secure print mode gives you peace of mind and full control over whom and when someone other than yourself sees your document.

Inbound transaction-oriented documents like claim forms, new account paperwork or hiring documentation account for a large percentage of the paper-based content enterprises struggle through every day. Digital transformation (DX) promises to automate and streamline these document-driven processes, so doesn it make sense to start DX there, too? Joseph Hanania Companies have a need right now to get started on their digital workplace, and one of the best ways to do that is around document and data workflows. remove the back-office barriers to participating in DX. truly helping customers transform their business processes, says my colleague, Andy Jones, Xerox Vice President, Workflow Automation, Large Enterprise Operations. DTPS goes beyond a digital mailroom or optimizing just one process or area, instead focusing on where the touch points are. The goal is to replace high-touch back office steps, starting with all the kinds of documents that trigger activities and processes. Incoming documents and other unstructured data often feed a main process within an organization. It could be a core business function, or flow into a legacy platform or solution. real power is when you connect DTPS into industry workflow solutions and drive those forward, notes Andy Jones. This collection of offsite document transaction services delivers key linkages and handover points from capture and processing activities into the core operation of custom business processes. The five capabilities brought together with the new DTPS reflect the typical document lifecycle: The connections between these capabilities come together under one unified environment, an advantage for avoiding the potential comple of process DX. DTPS enables DX by improving the flow of information into digital business processes, and that starts with capture. A major innovation is letting customers interact at the front end of the process. That necessary in environments involving ad hoc capture and input, or geographically low volume locations. These businesses don want to wait on a separate process to handle their small input load, yet it just as important to them as it is a to a business with hundreds or thousands of documents a day. Capture is dynamic when it uploads and enters information in real time. There been an increase in dynamic capture, as we go from paper input at a multifunction device to more dynamic capture from mobile devices. Where organizations have intelligent devices under MPS contract, they can use intelligent MFDs to directly ingest information from custom menus on devices or from mobile devices used as cameras. Dynamic capture allows image correction on the device itself and uploading into the processing app. The user can validate data at the smart device and pass it on to the ne point in the process. The challenge is that mobile workflow can be quite open to the environment. All of our mobile data capture is highly secure. Having captured and validated information, any local copies on devices get erased once the correct copy goes into the workflow. Although the scale may differ, the SMB market, the channel and large enterprises face similar operational challenges, and organizations of all kinds are turning to DX to solve them. It levels the playing field through technology, and the need for DX-enabling services is growing almost everywhere. The new Xerox DTPS unify the process environment, bringing DX that much closer to back-office employee management and accounting platforms for a variety of enterprises. In coming blogs, we cover the Transform stage in detail, along other the other aspects of DTPS and its role in Digital Transformation.

HA. We have more paper than ever before and our worlds are not paperless. In fact, I think paper is GOOD. I love business cards, thank you cards, colorful hand outs and I can much better digest printing out a longer report or other document than scrolling up and down a computer screen, phone or tablet! However, I think what a paperless office really means is the better management of the paper in our lives. Business owners today feel increasing pressure to get more done in less time. We have so many great tools at our disposal to automate almost everything we do, but knowing e which tools to use for each process can be tricky. One of the best things professionals can do is to move away from outdated processes that cost time and dramatically reduce productivity. By moving to document management, I been able to streamline processes that would have traditionally taken multiple steps. It important to have tools that work well together to create , using smart strategies to fold paper-based documents into digital workflows. Find the best tools to make your office paperless via @RamonRay Sure, I receive lots of information in paper format, and most of it can be thrown out or recycled by the end of the day. But, what happens to those documents that linger on the corner of your desk? They ones that are really important, but don have a home in a filing cabinet. That when I realize just how valuable being paperless is. From my multifunction printer, all I have to do is scan my documents directly to Dropbox (or Google Drive or Office 365) or email and they e where I can access them from wherever I am. If you have a team, you can even sync files in your Dropbox accounts, where they can either print them out or download them to their hard drives. For cash management and accounting, I use . It integrates with all of the other software I use and thanks to its reporting, I can pull out e what I need when it time to file ta. QuickBooks lets you only pay for the features you use, too, which makes it great for small businesses that only don need a comprehensive bookkeeping package. Of course Xero, Freshbooks and other solutions work well for small business financial management as well. Document routing can be time consuming, even if you do so without using paper. How much time is wasted each day as we email paperwork from one person to another? I found it best to establish a process with your team, and use document management software to help route for you. Once your procedure is established, you canjust choose a person from a drop-down box and send it on its way.

Here is the video interview and you can read the transcript below the video. Hey Mark, we have been talking about how process and e has been so important to the success of your business, can you kind of elaborate on some of the processes you use in your business to drive success Sure, well Tom thanks for having me here today. You know, as we discussed earlier we really feel that in this competitive marketplace you must systematize the sales processes in order to leverage today efforts and really be able to ma them for long term growth and sustainability. We feel that there are five core components of an effective sales management program and as you define this within your own business, regardless of how many steps there are, we would really encourage you to organise around business function. Then around those functions build systems and allow the systems to run the business and the people to run the systems. People may come and go, but the systems will always be in place. For long-term growth and sustainability, you need to systematize your sales processes Are these technology systems, or people systems, or both? Well I think it comes down to people, process and technology. I think it was said best by in a book that he wrote called the . He said that in order for any business to succeed it must first become a system so that that system functions the same way every time down to the last detail Yes then customers know what to e from you as well Absolutely Are there any best practices that you have within your sales management process that you could share? So, we feel that the core foundation is a piece of technology within the process and you have to have a CRM a customer retention program to be able to mine your data, market to your data and that really becomes step one. That then is followed by lead generation, and then pipeline or sales process, management of that pipeline, that leads to forecasting and then probably to the most effective or important matter that out there that is cashflow projections. Absolutely. How about from a customer acquisition perspective is there anything unique that you guys do? You know, our system really starts with mining UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) data, so we know where ripe opportunities are in the market. They are run by an internal marketing development business group, that finds leads, hands them over to the salespeople and then the salespeople start to take over the relationship and that really where the sales management process starts. Obviously, the systems that you have didn happen overnight, you evolved them over time. So what advice do you have for other folks out there that are looking to improve their processes. You know I think you have to document them. Until they are documented and published, they don e. Until you have taken a process and put it in the field and watched it fail, and have the opportunity to correct the deficiencies within the process, you can get to the final outcome of something that works effectively every time. First, you must document your processes until you do they don e That great well I appreciate the insight, it great be able to sit down with you for a little bit, thank you very much.

Actually it more likely the other way around, with cubicle workers becoming a subset of the mobile population. The truth of it is, we all mobile now. Many predictions foresaw , and it probably safe to say we hit that mark. Do you know any colleague who doesn own a smartphone? Most knowledge workers are mobile at some time or other. You might be a mobile worker if: Each industry has its own version of the mobile or untethered worker. In the insurance sector, an agent completes a claim on site, taking pictures of an accident and uploading them in a digital claim form. In the medical field, tablet-toting nurses and doctors access your medical files and take down your information, and today, it even possible for surgery to be performed remotely. In education, teachers hold regular classes remotely via online instruction models. Students can get degrees in a mobile way without even being in the same state or country as their school. like these are transforming the way businesses work, and that will continue, because we just beginning to see the impact of mobility in large enterprises. We haven reached the tipping point of tablets, , smartphones and what now seem almost dated laptops. Functionality once available only on premise are now easily accessible via the cloud, and this will continue as a major trend. Along with the proliferation of smart phones and tablets have come new solutions that let us work with business documents in our mobile environments. A frequent traveler can get a jump on e reports and meet company deadlines for filing them. She just sends smartphone pictures of the hotel folio and ta receipts directly to her administrative assistant. It not just an alternative way to submit e; it a faster, more accurate business process. When an e needs to receive, review and sign a contract, he doesn have wait until he at his hotel to pick up a fax, read it, sign it and scan or fax it back. With a tool like , this busy e can access, read, annotate, approve and share an important, time-sensitive document right from his tablet or PC. Another faster, better process. The productivity enhancements emerging to meet the need of the mobile workforce are transforming the way we work. It a trend that gone beyond mobile print into the realm of information access and use. Continued innovation focused on mobile productivity and security will have tremendous impact on how we get work done on the road or wherever we are. The result will be offerings we may not necessarily think of as mobile solutions, but as part of the bigger picture of digital transformation.

A marketing firm was promoting its television, social media, and mobile marketing services by bashing direct mail. (especially business customers, which were the focus of the commercial) Obviously, this marketing firm hasn kept up with the data. Sure, social media and mobile marketing are on the rise. But that doesn mean that customers aren responding to or that this channel is losing its effectiveness in the B2B market (or in the B2C market either). It a false contrast. Your customers are faced with these false contrasts all the time. Day in and day out, they are bombarded with false messaging that direct mail is dead. . Here are some points to keep in front of them. You don have to get recipient permission to send direct mail. Unlike email and te messaging, people don have to opt in. This means that, even if a customer does not subscribe or unsubscribes from your email list, you can still reach them with direct mail. (This is a great reason to make sure you always get physical addresses from those on your email lists!) , it may be skimmed by a gate keeper, notes Roger Buck, former director of marketing/new product development for The Flesh Company, responding to an invitation to comment on this subject on my LinkedIn page. , the odds are still much better and it doesn contain a virus. 8 reasons why printed Direct Mail is more effective than Email Marketing Think of it as the equivalent to consumers taping things to their refrigerator. had people tell us that they had one of our mailings sitting on their desks for months, notes Andre Palko, president of Technifold USA, adding his voice to the comments. they didn act immediately, we remained top of mind until they were ready to act. You don get that kind of staying power attention email. If you send an email to someone who no longer there, it bounces. If you send a postcard, the new person in that job sees it you just introduced yourself as a vendor, says Palko. Email is an effective tool, but we are overwhelmed by it. This is true of consumers, but even more of businesses. In 2014, The Radicati Group found that business users sent or received 121 emails per day. By 2018, this is e to rise to 141. Larry Bradley, owner of Proforma Sunbelt Graphics, writes, overwhelming volume of email received at work is a huge hurdle for legitimate email marketers. It hard to separate the junk from the legitimate email. As a result, a huge percentage of email sent to businesses is never read. Businesses don receive nearly as much marketing mail as they did a decade ago. That a unique benefit for direct mailers. There is a reason businesses are more likely to get lending offers in the mail than they are by email. B2B decision-makers trust direct mail more than email, especially for high value products and services. Mailers can also include a wide variety of trust-building content not possible (or reasonable) to include in email. Yes, you can provide links, but with , you get that content in front of them in a tangible way right out of the gate. There are only so many things you can do to make email look more important, but beyond writing a compelling subject line, most of them look hokey. Direct mail offers options like kits, dimensional mail, and unique packaging options that, by their nature, get past the gatekeepers. (Palko has used everything from metallic envelopes, lunch bags, packing list pouches, and prescription bottles to mail letters. are not only fun, but they get opened! he says.) While these mailings may have higher price tags, they can also get near 100% open rates. When you trying to reach the C-Suite, what that worth? I go back to the television commercial I watched. The claim was that you don need because you have social media and mobile marketing. What was is how those social media and mobile marketing relationships get captured in the first place. Very often, that print! Saying that you only need social and mobile but not print is akin to saying that when buying a house you only need the upper stories but not the foundation. Without print, getting those social and mobile engagements would be much more difficult. Don let digital marketers get away with stealing your customers based on false contrasts. Open the discussion about the benefits of direct mail versus email, and when to use each. Be proactive. Don give digital-only marketers an unprotected flank.

Can you reach a larger prospect base and still make sure your sales process has a personal touch? How do you scale ? It one of the biggest yet most rewarding challenges in small and medium size businesses. The key lies in empowering your salespeople best intentions. Large, stable enterprises can afford to have huge sales teams that meet the needs of prospects across industries and regions. They can maintain a ratio of salespeople to prospects that makes personalized service affordable and even efficient. But when small companies are growing fast, things are rarely this neat. The e sales team often has to over-e itself just to keep up with all the new prospects they pursuing. More importantly, the company likely hasn built up enough brand equity to start resting on its laurels either. It an incredible amount of pressure on scarce resources at a time when the success of any relationship still hinges on the relevance of the proposal being submitted. Your prospects are still thinking: Growing? How to free up your sales team so they can focus on your clients. #workingbetter Scale is hard because your salespeople have to make a bigger impact in a smaller amount of time, serving more people than they would have just a few months ago. But it important to remember that even though your sales team may have spent more time focusing on a prospect when the business was smaller, it not like they were doing it . They still had to spend a fair chunk of time doing their homework and drafting the right proposal. Really, the major challenge of growth is replacing your inefficient, small company processes losing the small company feeling. If your workflow for drafting, reviewing and submitting a proposal is a slow, paper-based slog . If it takes them ages to find and file their paperwork them better ways to manage that information. If they practically rewriting whole proposals from scratch, make sure they can easily customize e drafts. Even tiniest inefficiencies add up. . If you just got rid of the old document processes that get in their way, you be able to give each one each salesperson thirteen e hours to personalize their proposals. After that, you can give them powerful new ways to personalize their proposals and automate the admin. Like , an easy way to print from mobile devices. Or , which lets sales people scan directly into cloud services like Evernote or GoogleDrive then assemble new proposals from these assets. (It also supports custom and workflow recipes that sales people love once they discover but that for another time). This stuff matters. Because, when you were a small business, you could get away with adding a personal touch even if you did it in an inefficient way. But as your business scales, so do its inefficiencies. And if you aren careful, those inefficiencies will strangle your sales team ability to personalize when their success depends on a personal touch the most.

If you running IT for a growing business, you probably spending all your time reacting to issues, accommodating new people and managing infrastructure at breakneck speed. So if you see something like unused documents lying in printer trays, they understandably look like the least of your worries. But if you looked a little closer, they raise some important questions. And that just for unused documents. The symptoms of broken document management actually impact every person and process in the company. Analyze where the documents come from, how they move and where they need to end up and you won just be improving things like printer placement and device policies you be impacting the way your firm communicates. The first step is all about assessing the way you currently manage documents and understanding what works and what doesn. Start asking questions like: Once you carried out a thorough assessment of your document management landscape, you realize how vital an area this is for attention. From there, it just a matter of identifying the right solutions to those issues determining what can be automated, what needs to be secured and who needs to be given control.

If you haven had a chance to read it yet, here the bullet point version: As anyone who has managed a blog will tell you, blogging can still be one the most difficult marketing tactics to e well and consistently. In fact, I was on a call yesterday with a Xerox channel partner (I really was) and they told me that they had blogging in the past but had struggled to keep it going. When it came to budget time, it was one of the first things that got dropped. There are many reasons why this may have happened. I be honest with you, I didn conduct an autopsy on the call. But, I did get a sense that coming up with ideas on what to write about was a key contributor. Four ways to find blog topics your audience will care about - and read I in a marketing role. I belong to a marketing team, in a marketing group. It would be very easy to sit here and fill this blog with nothing but marketing topics. But, you need to write for someone, about something. So tip number one, connect with everyone in your organisation who has any form of customer contact. Customer support, call centre staff, service technicians, your receptionist, showroom staff and of course your sales team are talking to customers all of the time.

As our team writes blog articles for dealers we also encourage their SME to add additional articles. However, if things get busy (and they always do) the dealer can know that they will at least have a minimum of one blog article a week for Google to index and reps to share on their social networks.

It also means they passed through the awareness phase and possibly even the consideration phase of your sales funnel before you met. The answer to reaching these prospects lies in inbound sales and marketing strategy; a complex process for ensuring prospects find your website and self-serve the information they need. Content is at the heart of inbound sales and marketing but not all content serves the same purpose, is relevant, or consumed. In fact, because it not read at all. However, we know content is critical for demand and lead generation so, the question is: where should channel partners focus their time and energy in order to create content that coverts? Marketing and sales content are different. Marketing content is geared at top of the funnel awareness building and middle of the funnel consideration. It more about story telling, developing trust and establishing your brand and it most often consumed before you met the prospect. Sales content drives conversions from prospect to customer. It meant to convince and act as a tipping point so buying decisions land in your favor. In order to create content that resonates with your audience, it important to know the desired outcome and then map the content to your goals. My recent article, , covers this process in detail. Why Content Development is Essential for Driving Sales. The relationship between sales and marketing is notoriously love-hate, but at the end of the day we have the same goals drive leads and close deals. Typically content development tasks fall on marketing, but sales has vital insight to add. However, many sales people aren thinking about content in the course of their day and often the treasure trove of topic ideas they have are never conveyed to marketing. Don miss the opportunity to debrief with your sales teams to find out what customers are saying, which print and copy features they want most, what solutions are selling and why, and other intelligence they gathering while speaking with prospects and current customers. All of that information can be turned into content. For topic ideas visit: . Buyers begin their online research by entering keywords and phrases looking for topics relevant to their need. Search engines then periodically index websites and gather information on your business and content topics that allow them to display results for what they consider to be the most relevant content. This is the foundation of SEO and it becomes complicated quickly but for the sake of having your content found and consumed, two of the most important factors are: Both factors are tied to user behavior and underscores why the topics have to be relevant to your buyers, solve their pains, and answer their questions. It also underscores why it important to have well written content and use social media platforms to drive engagement (shares). Moz, a company with high authority in the SEO space and Buzzsumo, a company with high authority in the content development teamed up to conduct detailed research into factors that impact sharing and linking. The full finding can be found . Let look at some of the over arching findings on : The research shows that most often people share content because it entertaining, useful, inspiring, amazing, or includes discounts or offers. On the other hand, more links point to content that is comprehensive, doesn change with age, is authoritative, and highlights a partnership or reciprocity. As an e, maybe you partner with a company whose products pair well with yours. Write an article highlighting how your combined solutions solve a business challenge then socialize and promote the content across both company audiences for a larger reach. Content is critical for demand and lead generation. How to create content that converts to sales. Writing and developing content takes time, there no way around it but there are ways to stretch one piece across the funnel by starting with longer, research-based content which statistically gains more shares. It might take time to gather the information needed to write a long and researched article but once done, it can be turned into other highly shareable and linkable content such as: Content development is essential to capturing leads and driving demand online and it necessary in order to start conversations with buyers before they connect with you. Of course it takes time to develop content that will be well received by your audience but doing so is well worth the effort.

However, there is a big problem with this. In my last article I talked about the . However, unless a prospect is ready to buy (which is rarely the case), they likely will read your website and then go away without doing anything. That means all the effort you spent on your website is wasted. Therefore it is essential that your website has a call to action. A call to action is a specific request for a prospect to do something as a result of engaging with your website. It is the one thing that you would like them to do if they like what they see. In effect, it the ne stage of your sales cycle. I have seen a few websites from printing companies that have a clear call to action. You may want people to visit your website, but the visit is pointless unless the prospect does something. Those companies that do have a call to action usually feature one that is unlikely to happen. How many people are really going to pick up the phone and call a company as a result of visiting their website? This is an unlikely scenario unless the prospect is looking for a specific type of printed product right now. That why it far better to have a softer call to action that allows you to communicate with your prospects on a regular basis. My suggestion is that you encourage people to sign up to an email or a physical mailing list. Once you have prospects who have opted into your list, you are able to send them interesting information on a regular basis. It is possible to measure the people who are most engaged with your list. You can move these people straight into your calling system. Suddenly, you have warm prospects to call. Some people may see a problem with this system. If you want people to sign up to your mailing list, you need to do three things: You need to offer prospects something in return for signing up to your list. This could be a free download of useful information. Alternatively, you could consider giving people a free demonstration of new marketing techniques, credit towards consultative services or an audit of their marketing or print strategies. You may be surprised, but you need really clear instructions for people to take action. Make sure that you issue clear instructions at several points on your website. If you want to start creating warm prospects in this manner, you need to take action. Don let your customers be like the athlete who never trained.

Ive been coming to this conference as either a visitor or a speaker from the start. I recognise a few familiar faces, but Im also happy to see plenty of fresh folks.;This mix of young and old reminds me of the Rejuvenate Opportunity Now or RON workshops that Shell holds to refresh our thinking on how hydrocarbons formed in mature basins, how they moved around and where theyre hiding now. At these workshops, we bring together geologists who are currently e a basin and geologists who e the same basin five, 10 even 30 years ago.;Hundreds of years of accumulated e are pitted against minds that have not accepted the prevailing dogmas. Since Mother Nature always seems to be much more complex than what we imagine, questioning dogmas and even busting them to pieces is generally necessary to come up with new plays.;In our latest RON workshop, six new plays were conceived within one week of intense brainstorming. And drilling has already begun to test them.;Incidentally, we go strictly old school at the RON workshops: no electronics allowed. The participants even those of the iPad generation have nothing but coloured pencils, map-overlay sheetsand brains. In some cases, weve had to hold these workshops in warehouses so that there is enough space for the maps to be spread out on the floor and walls.;These workshops embody the parado mi that I think propels geoscience to go beyond the conventional: flighty imagination and well-grounded knowledge; doing things differently and doing more of the same.;Because theres a good chance Im the oldest panellist here today, I hope youll let me reminisce a bit more to e what I mean.;When I got my PhD in geology, te made a clear distinction between source rock (where crude oil or natural gas formed) and reservoir rock (where the hydrocarbons ultimately are found). Source rock and reservoir rock were always assumed to be in separate formations, because oil and gas have a tendency to move once theyre formed. In fact, the reason theyre found in voluminous accumulations is only because their upward passage is occasionally blocked by impermeable-rock seals.;But recent developments have shown how limiting that te paradigm was. Source and reservoir can be one and the same formation. In fact, they can even consist of the same basic rock shale that often seals conventional oil or gas traps. So source, reservoir and seal have in this sense become indistinguishable.;This paradigm shift has moved the industry from under the shadow of peak oil into the wide-open era of diffuse oil. Many countries that lack sizeable accumulations of conventional oil are now eagerly seeing whether they have any better luck with unconventional oil in shale formations. The same applies even more to natural gas. Even in my native country, Switzerland, which is better known for its hydropower than its hydrocarbons, there is interest in shale oil and gas, and several independents have taken up concessions.;This paradigm shift has also made ill-defined rock properties, like fraccability, much more important than they were in my university days. And it has highlighted the link between geomechanics and geophysics.;Geomechanics governs the way rocks crack. Geophysics, of course, is at the heart of seismic. They are both based on similar principles, but the former is based on static stresses whereas the latter is based on dynamic wave propagation. Wouldnt it be great if one could reveal something about the other?;That, in fact, seems to be possible. We at Shell have used the relationship between seismic attributes and geomechanical rock properties to evaluate the estimated ultimate recovery per well in undrilled areas of the Montney formation in Canada. Much more information pertaining to the hydraulic fracturing of formations could be gleaned from new technologies related to seismic.;But in seismic, the name of the game is data high-quality data. The more, the better. Shell now has 250 times more computing capacity dedicated to geophysical processing than it had 10 years ago. And we had better get ready to gather, process and visualise a lot more data.;For e, Shell is working to develop a wireless micro-electromechanical geophone system that can be scaled up to one million channels. This will provide much denser imaging of onshore fields and reveal much greater detail of key geological structures. We have also trialled in Qatar and the Sultanate of Oman a fibre-optic seismic acquisition system that can gather far more data in one go than ever before.;Time for a reality check.;Achieving e results is not simply a matter of coming up with new ideas at workshops, or even capitalising on the e growth of computing power. Sometimes an e practice or design a technology is pretty near optimal. In such a case, that technology has to be standardised so that it can be easily replicated everywhere to get the ma value out of it.;Consistent focus on standardisation and replication means we are able to reduce the time between taking final investment decision on a project and bringing that project on stream. Even in the early stages of technology development, questions about scalability have to be asked and satisfactorily answered.;At Shell, we are currently focusing on seven technology thrusts for widespread deployment around the world. These thrusts were identified on the basis of how valuable the technology is e to be and how well the technologys deployment could be integrated into business plans.;One such thrust involves GeoSigns, Shells software for subsurface visualisation. This software incorporates 29 major proprietary technologies for interpreting seismic data. It allows more than 1,200 Shell users worldwide to standardise the workflow for the analysis of time-lapse surveys or the location of sweet spots in tight formations, for e. It will also facilitate knowledge-sharing among Shells geoscientists and save costs.;More standardisation is also needed in drilling and completing wells for unconventional-gas developments the kind of approach that Shell is pursuing in a well-manufacturing joint venture with the China National Petroleum Corporation. Were pursuing a conveyor belt approach in which standard pieces of equipment carry out different stages in the drilling and completion process. In this way several wells can be worked on in parallel, rather than having one customised drilling rig working on one well at a time.;So to quickly sum up: Geoscience can deliver e results when several things happen at the same time. A few I have already mentioned:;Let me end by pointing out that, in every case, innovation is key in geological paradigms, in data acquisition and interpretation, and even in standardisation. And innovation is often best stimulated by sharing ideas much as the geologists at the RON Rejuvenate Opportunity Now workshops do.;Indeed, many ideas are worth sharing outside of RON workshops, because they gain strength by spreading. And as they spread and gain strength, they can set off a chain reaction of more innovation. The best innovation is infectious in this way.;We at Shell are big believers in this kind of open innovation, because it helps speed up developments that are likely to feature prominently in tomorrows energy system. To this end, were forging collaborations with companies outside our industry, were undertaking joint research projects with government and academic institutions, and were providing venture capital to early-stage technology companies.;These efforts too will help take geoscience beyond the conventional.;Thank you.'",shell,21,33,247.035,0.2,NA,n,y,n,n,n,-0.0424638657,0.0085902076,-0.0107982317,-0.0323428247,-0.023911424,7870,555,7.0520965693,40.42,n,n,y,y,y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It one of those phrases we see everywhere now, so much so we don see it at all. It become as common as, well. Most people tune out buzzwords unless they specific to our interests and concerns. If your interest lies in business documents, the information they hold, and the workflows that move them, you have good reason to pay attention to this cloud story. start with why cloud matters to document workflow. Businesses continue to face challenges with launching and maintaining both with hardware and software aspects of document infrastructure. Why cloud matters is that cloud services and platforms help solve these and other issues: -based services have become part of the push to remove comple from document-centric workflows, while making them easier to acquire. When cloud-hosted as an on-site software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering, document management technology drives cost out of your operation, while increasing your productivity through simpler workflow. Cloud-based document services enable automated, repeatable processes that can be deployed and managed with less stress and e on your organization. Standardized document processes support workflow optimization, risk assessment and audit reporting. Another outcome is faster delivery of information to customers, suppliers, agents and others, which fosters loyalty and satisfaction. else should you look for in cloud-based document workflow services and platforms? Here are some of the essentials: , implementation and support services are included in some of the latest offerings on the market. These solutions support process optimization, risk assessment and audit reporting. Xerox has two new cloud-based offerings developed to provide document management and workflow automation at the personal and enterprise levels. is a cloud-delivered Enterprise Content Management and Process Automation solution. Xerox also just announced a private cloud version of its personal workflow automation service. The solution can either be and can integrate tightly with other components of the wider enterprise IT infrastructure. consider partnering with a vendor who also provides to smoothly integrate device capture technology into your cloud environment. By combining a variety of resources hardware, software and e the right partner can accelerate process automation by capturing, storing, sharing and transforming paper-based and electronic documents. When cloud-based document management is combined with Managed Print Services, your multifunction printers can be leveraged to provide turnkey content management. Whether you start with personal document workflows or something bigger, look to the cloud for a very compelling strategy for enterprise document management, or even your digital transformation. Cloud underpins all the other aspects of digital transformation mobile, social, big data which makes it a word worth noticing. Hi Carro. In the last section, why do you generically refer to partnering a vendor. Xerox is a leading company in the MPS space and in theory we should not need to be working with MPS partners. First, thanks for reading the Enterprise Matters blog, Chuck, AND commenting. To your point, we not suggesting that Xerox partner with an MPS provider (sorry if that was unclear,) rather we suggesting our readers ask the right questions when they choose an MPS partner, and hopefully that decision is Xerox. We want our readers to take the information we share and use it to make the best choices for their business, so we try to keep it as objective as we can.

Andy Hill September marked the first anniversary of this blog the Channel Partner Connection. In that time we have covered a multitude of topics from digital marketing, to building MFP solutions, to good old selling and we try to highlight Xerox channel partner successes from across the globe whenever we can. Along the way, we have learnt a few lessons about B2B blogging here are a few of them. Four ways blogs are a critical component to an inbound demand generation strategy Blogs are a critical component to any inbound demand generation strategy: 1. drive search engine optimization (SEO) by providing keyword-rich content for search engines to index . provide you with interesting content for you to share on your social networks . help establish your authority in your niche or industry . give your visitors information they need before they buy from you. , 90% of their leads come from blogs published months or even years earlier. That makes building an arsenal of blogs a compelling idea. Yes, blogs take time and resources to create and the reward is not often immediate. Nevertheless, they are, without doubt, a tactic that keeps on giving. Indeed, on one of our blogs, an article written in is still receiving the lion share of visits in !. Blogs can contain a variety of components from words or graphics to Slideshare presentations and video. Regardless of which components you use, always strive for a heavy dose of topics with long-term relevancy. This is referred to as evergreen content and it is the reason Hubspot gets 90% of their leads from older posts. If you want your blogs to do the same, write about topics future buyers will still want to read a year from now and make those the cornerstone of your content strategy. Publishing more often will speed up the demand generation capabilities of your blog but producing poor quality, uninteresting content will not attract your audience no matter how often you post. It is better to publish something worth reading once a month than churn out unread words more often ( we try to publish at least once per week). Successful blogs give valuable information to a target audience. They answer burning questions, offer helpful advice, solve problems, teach and make life easier for the reader. Defining your audience is the first step. Those answers will guide you to the evergreen topics needed to draw future prospects to your blog and website. B2B buyers rarely leisure surf blogs so keep your content simple and educational B2B buyers are not leisure surfing your content. In fact, their attention span is only . That isn much time to work with. Your headline has to be compelling and your content succinct. Cutting out unnecessary words and delivering the point quickly is mission critical. Along with short attention spans comes skimming. In bygone days, we read to the bottom of a paper page and the volume of content we faced on a daily basis was not so overwhelming. Today with more than 2 million articles published daily, and with mouse in hand or finger poised, scrolling, swiping and skimming is the new reading. A compelling headline reels readers in. Succinctly written content moves them down the page. Subheads act as yield signs, slowing them from scrolling too fast and missing your point. Subheads also give visual separation making the ne portion of content bite-sized, which is e what an 8.25-second attention span requires. Every Xerox channel partner has a unique style and voice. Finding a strategy that works for your audience, in your region, is key to blogging success. Then, once you attract them remember that we humans are creatures of habit. Make consistency in cadence and content quality a priority. One of the most valuable insights I found from our blog is the information that Google Analytics, Social Sharing and Google Webmaster tools provide. By adding code to your blog you can learn where your visitors are from, what they use to browse on (device and type of browser) even how much time they spend on an article. By including social sharing tools such as and you can learn what articles are shared most and when. By connecting to your Google Analytics data you can learn about the search terms people use to find and (hopefully) click on your articles. You be amazed at the variety of spelling and phrases people use. All of this information is vital for informing your marketing so if you were in any doubt about why blogging needs to part of your marketing strategy I hope we have made you think again.

Citrix CloudStack is not just a traditional enterprise server virtualization platform with cloud management layered on top, it is a production-ready, ; that helps providers of all types deploy and manage simple, cost-effective cloud services that are scalable, secure, and open by design. The new release is based on the same CloudStack solution that has been used by some of the world\'s largest and most successful public clouds to roll out new cloud services up to 50 times faster and at one-fifth the cost of alternative solutions;. This is the first release of the product since ; in July. ; Recognizing that organizations currently face a daunting task when trying to build their own IaaS cloud environment, Citrix CloudStack provides customers with the fastest path to the cloud by providing the most advanced software technologies for building highly scalable, highly reliable cloud computing environments. More than ;, including GoDaddy, GreenQloud, KT, Nokia, ; and Zynga. ; As the industry ventures into the Cloud Era, a vast array of new cloud services will emerge, requiring platforms that are purpose-built for cloud computing radically different from the traditional enterprise datacenters of today. These platforms need to be designed from the ground up to deliver multi-tier, multi-tenant services in the simplest and most cost-effective way. CloudStack addresses these challenges with a powerful, hypervisor-agnostic solution designed to help organizations build clouds the way the world\'s largest and most successful public clouds are built - simple, automated, elastic, scalable and efficient. With advanced networking capabilities, high-availability and a robust web interface, CloudStack gives users complete control of their cloud infrastructure through a single pane of glass. ; By providing a cost effective and scalable cloud platform that works with all major enterprise virtualization technologies, Citrix CloudStack allows users to preserve their e virtualization investments - whether they are based on KVM, Oracle VM, vSphere, XenServer, or a mix of these technologies - while enabling them to continue to grow their virtual infrastructure. VMware users particularly benefit when they choose to deploy Citrix CloudStack over vCloud Director as their preferred cloud platform. By using Citrix CloudStack, VMware customers not only break free from the proprietary costs that VMware imposes with its platform, but they also gain the added fle and control associated with leveraging the most popular open source cloud platform in the market. Additionally, Citrix CloudStack eases the financial impact associated with the ""vTax,"" the term used by many in the cloud and virtualization communities to refer to the latest update to the VMware vSphere 5 licensing model that added costs to customers\' e cloud and virtualization implementations. Since CloudStack can support multiple hypervisors in the same cloud, VMware customers can mix and match their virtualization technologies under the same cloud environment and optimize their costs, as well as the business value. ; This latest release of CloudStack is a continuation of the company\'s efforts to provide VMware customers with an open source choice when building clouds on vSphere. In March, ; and has now e that work into CloudStack. In addition to adding enhanced support for vSphere and Oracle VM, the upcoming version of Citrix CloudStack will also enable bare metal provisioning, allowing users to increase the agility of their cloud deployment by provisioning and managing workloads on physical servers without a hypervisor. ; Citrix CloudStack with support for VMware vSphere and bare metal provisioning is available today as a free download from CloudStack.org or as a commercially supported solution from ;. Oracle VM support will be available in October, followed by Microsoft Hyper-V later in Q4. CloudStack can be deployed on-premise or as a hosted cloud service. ; ""By enhancing availability and support for VMware vSphere and Oracle VM, the latest release of Citrix CloudStack enables customers to build clouds on their e virtualization and datacenter technologies while taking advantage of the most widely deployed open source cloud platform today. A powerful, hypervisor-agnostic solution, CloudStack helps customers build clouds the way the world\'s largest and most successful public clouds are built - simple, automated, elastic, scalable and massively efficient.

As most people know, Xerox famed Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) invented the personal computer, along with many other underpinnings that have built the world of technology as we know it today including networking, WYSIWYG editing, the GUI, and much more. CNN* of give you a bit of history of the PC. Thanks to Xerox historian Ray Brewer, I have a , that describes personal information system for business professionals. It was the Xerox 8010 Star information system widely considered one of the most important milestones in the development of the modern PC age. I struck by how much personal computing has changed, and how much it has stayed the same. From our press release: Xerox 8010 Star information system includes a two-page desktop display, a keyboard, a small processor and an control device. That last part (emphasis mine) the mouse, a word that did not appear in the press release. I am hard-pressed to think of a PC maker that would bother to mention in a press release today albeit for an entirely different reason: It pretty much considered standard equipment by now. In addition to create, modify, store, and retrieve te, graphics and records, the press release also noted that users could documents via electronic mail to local and remote system users on Xerox Ethernet local area communications networks. So, yes, we talking about the precursor to the Internet as we know it today. 35 years ago, the first PC was 15 years ahead of its time. http:/ctt.ec/n21uI+ #EightiesCNN The DigiBarn Computer Museum in California describes as most complete implementation of the Metaphor of any systems until the advent of mature Desktop graphical interfaces later on the Mac and PS/Unix/Linux in the 1990s. The (Star) systems were a full 15 years ahead of their time. WYSIWYG : What You See (on the screen) Is What You Get (on the printer). This chart, drawn by the director of the museum, . There are, however, some things that have changed. According to that 1981 release, an introductory training session would ONLY take four hours to learn the basic functions of the machine. And the cost was $16,595, which included the basic software. I think we all come a long way. This is more than celebrating a jade anniversary; and it much more than highlighting quaint descriptions of technology that we take for granted 35 years later. Genius is not solely defined by invention. The true genius of invention is the human element can a person actually use this thing? All inventions must, as , the right problem in a way that people find natural and easy to use. As true today as ever. Today at Xerox, we taken the e of human/computer interaction well beyond the desktop. Our innovators are developing solutions that enable large organizations to benefit in real-time from the massive computing power that surrounds them. For e, last summer, working with the Public Sector and Transportation line of business in Xerox, we launched a product ( ) for parking enforcement organizations in Los Angeles and Denver. CitySight provides users with integrated, data-driven decision-making tools aimed at making them and the entire parking enforcement organization more efficient. You be hearing more about CitySight in the days to come. In the meantime, read on to learn more on how we help , how we to make work flow better. I wish they applied the Great love and committment they applied to the development of the Copiers in the 1950 to the Great invention for the humanity in the 80 The problem with the 1980 wasn innovation, but imagination and Xerox management at the time was not immune. They along with many others did not see the future market for PC. This is best illustrated with a major product decision they made in that decade. There were presentations made to Senior management from 2 different product development groups. One was from the Palo Alto PC group where a group of engineers had a difficult time helping the Sr Management Team see the potential for their product. The other group was from Dallas which was pitching the launch of an IBM selectric typewriter competitor, IBM essentially owned the type written creation market at that time with the selectric. Xerox marketing e (not engineers) made this presentation and easily convinced the Sr Team that their product had the immediate potential and Xerox went with the memory-writer line. Of course the typewriter market tanked as the word processing / PC industry matured and took hold so the memory-writer never drove the profits anticipated. Xerox later did bring out the 8010 Star, which true to their print centric focus had a mandatory printer attached. It was overpriced and poorly marketed so it too failed to make a market even though it did have some truly innovative features. be fair, many early entrants into this market failed to reap huge benefits (Wang, IBM and many Apple products come to mind), so Xerox is not alone in not capitalizing here. It took a while for the evolution of technology / hardware / software / operating systems to bring the potential of this market together. I used the Xerox 8010 Star system, which was installed at the Pentagon circa 1981. I thought it was truly transformative, replete with desktop icons, a mouse and modest computing power. Apple a decade later seemed to me to be an inferior copy of the operating system. I was truly sorry that Xerox didn know the kind of winner they had on their hands. Please correct if you something about this. heard a long time ago that Steve Jobs went to an office automation trade show and visited the Xerox booth. He went straightto the abandoned 8010 Star and asked for a demo. After much searching for someone who could demo it, he asked why they weren promoting the point and click technology. They e said that it will never work because the mouse will fall off the desk. this a PARC myth? Or does someone know? Thank you for writing. Ray Brewer manages the Xerox Historical Archives, so I asked him about your story. Here his reply: for your comment on the Xerox 8010 Star Post. that is an interesting story, I afraid many inaccuracies have crept in through the years. The 8010 Star was introduced shortly before Apple announced the Macintosh, so development was well underway at Apple on a computer that utilized the mouse concept. Jobs actually first saw the mouse while visiting PARC in early December 1979. He visited three times during the month, the first two visits not meeting his demands of having a real demonstration of the Alto Computer potential that he had heard about. The third visit is when he was shown a full blown system with a mouse and keyset that was networked and connected to a Dover Laser Printer. He was not so impressed with the entire system and capabilities (he should have been!) as he was with the mouse, graphical bitmap display and user interface. On April 14th, 1980, Xerox signed an agreement with Jobs where we loaned Apple ten Alto Computer controller devices as they were not called a mouse yet. it was actually the Alto Computer at PARC where Steve Jobs first saw a mouse, not an 8010 Star. Thank you so much for the correction! The innovators at PARC had such a powerful impact on our world today. I comforted that Xerox maintains a historical archive with so many great stories.

The first part of our four-part road test series took on the and Part Two covered the newest version of the Shelby GT-H. Now it time to find out what happens when you take a 2016-2017 Mustang GT, add some chili pepper personality, a good dose of Shelby American, and lots of tuning spice. What you get is the Shelby Terlingua Racing Team Mustang. As we tested our way through four new Shelby American built Mustangs, there no way we couldn drive anything with a name like this. Or perhaps it should be called . Just look at this awful yella (which is what Carroll Shelby named this color back in the 1960s), 750-horsepower screamer, and it shouts wild child from every pore. is a lot of things. It is first a place in central Te near Big Bend National Park, which today is largely a ghost town save for a handful of residents, a fun and appropriately touristy general store, an observatory, and a few other plantings. The word itself translates to Tongues and the town was named after the nearby Terlingua creek. The settlement was originally driven by silver mining, and later became famous for championship chili cook-offs including Carroll Shelby, among others. Carroll co-owned a rambling ranch house there, a place where he and his posse of pals used to gather for all manner of rebel rousing. Among his troop were lifelong friend and artist, Bill Neale, and former editor in chief of and magazines, the late David E. Davis Jr. The parties there are rumored to have been positively epic. Neale once told me of the odd mule or donkey wandering through the kitchen or dining room some mornings. related to cars, Shelby chose to name his 1967 Mustang SCCA Trans-Am squad the Terlingua Racing Team, not wanting to run it under the Shelby American banner, as he still had many irons in the fire with Ford and didn want any perception of conflict. Ford official factory backed Trans-Am effort was running Mercury Cougars that season, so the yellow-and-black notchback Mustangs ran the series as a somewhat back-door effort, not officially the Ford factory team. Artist Neale developed the Rabbit logo as yet another of Shelby ongoing efforts to poke a stick at Enzo Ferrari Horse identifier. To this day, Terlingua Racing Team stickers are omnipresent on Mustangs, assorted Fords and toolbo around the world. factory Cougars didn win the Trans-Am championship in 1967, nor did those pesky guys named Donohue and Penske either; nope, it was the screaming yellow Terlingua Racing Team effort led by Shelby and racing greats such as Jerry Titus and Milt Minter that brought the title home for Ford (even if corporately the company was obviously rooting for Mercury). modern-day Shelby American has twice developed a Terlingua street package Shelby Mustang honoring the team and celebrating that championship. The first-gen reborn Terlingua of a decade ago packed a supercharged 4.0-liter V-6 that could run with and often outrun the V-8s. The 2015-16 e features a supercharged V-8 only, cranking 750 horsepower out of its breathed-upon Coyote 5.0. of lightweight carbon fiber makes up the body mods for this decidedly Type A Shelby Mustang. The vented carbon fiber hood is a Terlingua-specific piece, are the composite front splitter, brake cooling ducts, mirror cap covers, rocker panels, a special rear spoiler, and model-unique grilles. The Big T gets its own unique taillight panel, rear fascia diffuser, and upper and lower grilles. The black-and-yellow paint scheme mocks that of the T-Team race cars of , and the ID package includes Neale unique grille badge, a C-pillar emblem, Shelby lettering on the tail, and Terlingua Racing side panel decals, plus a set of door number meatballs. stock GT 435 horsepower becomes 750 at the hands of a yellow-powdercoated aftermarket blower, a Ford Performance / Borla e system, special tuning, and heavy duty cooling. Shelby will build the car to automatic or 6-speed manual spec. Our test car bears serial number 1, the car used to develop and test the package; it is owned by Shelby American, and has been known to go head-to-head at the dragstrip with a Hellcat. Or two. Venice-model alloys come courtesy of Weld Racing Wheels, taping at 9.5 x 20-inch front and 10.5 x 20-inch rear, wrapped by appropriately sized high-performance rubber. Eibach amps-up the suspension with its adjustable shocks, and Brembo provides the massive six- and four-piston brakes. Ford Performance serves up a 3.73:1 rear-diff gear for manual-trans cars (3.55 for automatics), plus the rear halfshafts and a short-throw shifter. The engine compartment enjoys a Terlingua caps kit, and adjustable caster/camber plates. Inside the cabin bears a CSM numbered ID plate carrying the reproduced signatures of Carroll Shelby, Bill Neale and Jerry Titus. The headrest covers get a makeover, and the upper IP also earns a carbon fiber gauge-pod cluster, with dials monitoring boost, fuel and oil pressure. The backlit door-sill plates and floor mats are also Shelby pieces. And naturally, there are several options if you want to go wilder yet. one lights up with a husky bark, underpinned by the whine of the supercharger and the rumbling pipes. And it launches as loud and hard as you want. The powerband is ferocious, with a healthy tire bark between shifts. We noticed a few small dents in the powerband, the power delivery not as glassy smooth as we e, but again this was the first one built, has a fair number of miles on it, and it has withstood hundreds of track laps and countless hard runs through the quarter, so it not as fresh or dialed-in as would be a new car wearing any production updates, and not so many WOT miles under its belt. It by no means poorly mannered, mind you, but it feels like a unit that lived hard yet generally no worse for the wear. It starts and runs fine, every time, with no funny noises, overheating, rough idle or other particularly bad manners meaning that the underlying Mustang platform and powertrain can take the heat, and that the Ford Performance and Shelby upgrades really deliver the goods, and also last. This one absolutely feels edgier and more track intensive and intended than the others; we confident you be running with, and outrunning, some seriously big name at your ne weekend open track event in this. in spirited (OK, aggressive) street driving, we noticed handling improvements similar to those found on the GT-H and GTE, perhaps with those Ford Performance suspension-equipped cars riding modestly better; the Terlingua adjustable Eibachs are a little firmer, and the 20-inch rolling stock means less sidewall, although the ride is still street worthy, just not as polished as the other two. Which is all right, because this screaming-yellow zonker honors a championship race car, earning its Wild Thang Shelby stripes. You won hide this car big personality from anything, or anyone. Now bring on those Vettes and Hellcats, but bring money Shelby commands $65,999, plus the cost of the new Mustang underneath, to have your very own Terlingua a lot of speed and solid content but a lot of dough plus the base cost of the car in any light. It not being actively marketed as member of the 2017 model roster, but Shelby American will gladly custom build you one if it the one you want.'",ford,6,31,241.034,0.3,-0.5,n,y,n,n,n,-0.00308496,0.0003597874,-0.0042761508,-0.0298784507,-0.0172157483,7438,491,6.6012368916,58.05,y,n,y,y,n,2,5,3,1,4

Simon Tune Managed Print Services (MPS) was born in the enterprise market and, over a number of years, has moved into the SMB space. Whilst MPS clearly has a place, do all SMB customers require the all-encompassing services and benefits that it offers? For some, MPS may have connotations of comple, lengthy, binding contracts and unpleasant administration. So, is there a place, where print and IT really converge for a as a Service offering, delivered through either the print reseller or the IT services company alongside their portfolio of managed services? I think there is. How 'Print as a Service' gives IT Resellers a low-risk print annuity Print as a Service (PRaaS) promises delivery of traditional print annuities, as well as the opportunity to diversify into IT services with a low touch, profitable offering. With over 6 million A4 devices pushed into the western European market each year*, print is the dominant technology. Does the low entry-price point, when compared with a portfolio of a service offerings, afford an IT reseller a subscription model revenue and margin opportunity at low risk? For print resellers, this represents a risk to your traditional business model. As a test of the risk profile go through your customer base and ask yourself I own the whole print requirement here, or here, or here? If the answer is no maybe it time to think about offering PRaaS before someone else muscles in on the opportunity. Let ask a few logical questions, I am sure there are more The provision of networks, storage and servers etc. could this also include print hardware? Are IT resellers including print, which may make the cost relatively invisible in a total infrastructure service package? A virtual desktop supporting a BYOD policy what are the implications for print? How could an IT reseller support with basic, remotely deployable or pre-configured mobile print applications? How are IT resellers using remotely deployable workflow applications that can form an integral and simple part of the backup service? Are they? Three ways IT Resellers could e their 'as a service' offering with print As part of the Print as a Service principle, let not overlook the obvious; healthy annuity streams that are captured from print. Think as a Service and how this is complemented by a simple cloud-based, remotely deployed and brand agnostic platform that allows you to control print revenues and ensure optimal device uptime for your clients. Print technology is bringing IT and print together. SMB customers are looking for single suppliers across print and IT but today there is a gap in service offerings. PRaaS can close that gap, but it will require vendors, like Xerox, to support channel partners with a value proposition, delivery mechanism, and infrastructure.

There are also general accounting and risk management workflows for e compliance management. It important to identify the labor- and document-intensive financial processes and identify solutions to drive productivity. A good e would be in transforming AP transaction processing to increase the amount of automated workflow to replace manual effort. see paper-based processes all around, including the simple process of getting signatures for incentive payouts or accounting representation letters. The old way of working is to circulate the paper for signatures, sign / scan / forward sign / scan / forward, etc. It too paper-intensive and time-consuming. New ways of working include tools like for easier document management, sometimes in combination with for electronic signatures. Bringing personal productivity solutions like these into the finance function is one of the many ways Xerox helps companies with the print-to-digital transformation. Craig Albright processes are typically time-critical and connected. Monthly financial close process, for e, has elements that must be completed on specific workdays to enable other elements to continue. Of course, there the need for accuracy, confidentiality and increased security. This is foundational to have strong controls throughout the process. There also the need for effective data mining, transparency and the ability to perform if scenarios the value-add of finance. advantages of finance process automation are: think in many ways we are still scratching the surface of what can be done in moving from paper to paperless environments. We have seen some great software solutions get introduced over the past decade, but most companies still operate in a very manual way. A good way to see where you stand is to run a workflow assessment and see e where labor and documents are concentrated. Some assessments only take a few days. Then follow that up with e sessions to identify process specific solutions to transform how the work gets done. most common issue I see holding organizations back from process automation is in not recognizing just how much labor or paperwork is still involved in the financial process. If a process has been moved off shore, it is especially easy to lose track of how it performing, and where there may be real opportunities for workflow solutions. This is where a fact-based assessment is most valuable. e has been that it is best to start by getting a grip on the current environment what processes are in play, how are these processes performing relative to benchmarks and where are these processes most labor and document intensive? the spirit of not re-inventing the wheel, it might be good to target first the transaction processes. are some great solutions available, including from Xerox, to help streamline processes like Accounts Payable or Compliance Management. CFO for Xerox Europe during the Eurozone Crisis, our business was under intense pressure to drive real cost productivity, while continuing to strengthen our control environment and manage cash flow. I led a financial transformation program for a finance group of hundreds of professionals set out to reduce our costs dramatically. I started by laying out the case for change. We needed to be more efficient, so that we could compete effectively in the marketplace. I assembled a team to help me build the fact base of our financial processes, our current state position and our target operating model. One e of automating our process was in using automation to prioritize cash collections, and there were many opportunities to continue to e. By the end of the first two years, we had reduced costs by 20-25 percent and set the course for years of continuous productivity. leaders want a solution that points to finding new productivity and real savings, and they want someone to help to implement, with a low cost of investment to get to payback faster. We want solutions that improve, control and strengthen financial operations though data and transparency. want proof points to see that it works, that the solution isn untested and completely new. I mentioned, I actually done that in my career, and my advice would to set it up as a program and not a one-off effort. We put a team around it and made a more structured, project-type approach. It also got to be fact-based. If I wanted to find opportunities, I would go to the process leader whoever is running your process, . for e. Focus on bite-size pieces that can demonstrate success. It also helps to just start talking about it. Pick up phone and call someone you trust. Call me if you want. ( ) a journey. Make sure you find good partners and good advisors to help e the many opportunities that e. Think about Xerox for the e we can bring in helping to improve the flow of work in your business. Great insight Craig! I agree, we are only scratching the surface towards the future of digitization. Glad to see Xerox is leading the way.

Ben DeVries When implementing a new marketing tactic, it not always easy to know where to start. Recently we spoke with at (PDS), a Xerox Authorized Agent in Colorado. Ben and his team have worked hard to build a thriving video marketing strategy. It begins with the technical aspects of video planning and production that we covered in our article, and then employs specific strategy outlined here to build an audience and promote the videos. How channel partners can ma the impact of video with YouTube Completion is the ultimate goal of video and interaction is a close second. When people watch a video through to the end, then it, comment on it and subscribe to your YouTube channel an audience is built. People sometimes forget that YouTube is a social media platform owned by Google that helps boosts search results. Because shorter videos are easier to watch through to completion focusing on a succinct message delivered quickly is key to completion, the #1 goal of video marketing. Of all the types of videos PDS e with on their , classic how-to videos receive the most views. Showing prospects they can save money with Xerox products, fix common print errors, and recycle toner cartridges demonstrate your e and add value to the audience. It the value-add component that helps viewers interact with the comments and meets the #2 goal of video marketing, which is interaction. While uploading a finished video to your YouTube channel, the Video Manager offers an option to put a to action on the video at any point during the viewing cycle. For e, Ben and his team put a call to action telling viewers to our website at the end of their videos. Doing so helps drive viewers back to their website from YouTube after watching the video. Ben adds the end of their embedded videos. Doing so ensures it stops playing at the end and doesn continue playing ads or other channel videos automatically. Not doing so can result in YouTube auto-playing other videos not based on the content of this one, but based on the content the viewer has previously watched. It important to keep the viewer engaged with your videos and not diverting their attention to other types of content based on YouTube algorithms. Tools like help Ben and his team automatically publish videos on popular web 2.0 sites like Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, Blogger, LinkedIn, and others. Automated tools like this also work to create natural backlinks to your videos, which are key components in SEO and search rankings. Use your primary and secondary keywords in video titles because the title is one of the most heavily weighted factors to ranking well in search. Similar to website SEO, title tags and meta descriptions are also e important. Make sure you add these elements when uploading the video content and descriptions to YouTube. when adding descriptions, write a good amount of te and include keywords to improve rankings further. Because most people negate this step, including this in your strategy will help your videos rank higher than the multitude of people who don know this . When creating video descriptions add your company phone number and website to This ensures your contact information will automatically show on the snippet that appears when viewers search by keyword. YouTube authority grows when viewers interact with your videos by liking, sharing commenting or embedding them on websites. One of the factors in SEO that video impacts is called on page. This is how long a viewer spends on each page before leaving. Video is a way to entice viewers to stay longer on each page and in doing so improves search rankings. Don worry if you don have enough of your own video content to embed, using videos from high domain authority sources like Xerox also helps improves search rankings in the same way. YouTube makes it easy to share video links and embed videos in a webpages. This makes it easy to put video on your website and write blogs with videos included. Embedding video into blogs is a key strategy for PDS that has been met with consistently successful results. Ben highly recommends embedding videos from your YouTube account onto your website whenever possible. As he pointed out, it benefits both website SEO and YouTube channel authority. Do not try to promote your videos on Facebook by posting a link to the YouTube channel. Facebook and YouTube aren on speaking terms; so video links included in Facebook updates don receive much visibility. The work-around is to upload videos directly to Facebook or , and then share the website page as a link in a Facebook post.

Theres no questioning the profound impact and transformative business implications of these developments. But just as much as we focus on the innovations themselves, Citrix has always focused at least as much on what the future of work means for peoplethe way we work and live, the way our teams and organizations operate, the problems we can solve.;Now, in the digital era, its worth considering one of the most human questions of all: as machines become smarter and smarter, what will be left for smart people to do? Will machine intelligence replace human e?; In his keynote address at our recent Citrix Synergy event in Orlando, he e what it means to be an e in the age of machine learning, AI, and big data. In his view, innovations like these dont obviate the need for human e. In fact, they actually underscore the importance of the human intuition and insight in the future of work. The key is to understand the evolving nature of our role and the complementary relationship between human and machine intelligence in solving different types of problems.;Malcolms discussion of the future of work revolves around the difference between puzzles and mysteries, building on a theory first developed by a former U.S. intelligence e named Gregory Treverton. Put simply, a puzzle is a problem that you solve by acquiring and processing additional information. A mystery is a problem that you solve by making sense of the information that you already have.;This distinction is absolutely crucial to understand, so you can determine what kind of problem youre facing, and thus, how to approach its solution. If you treat every problem like a puzzle and throw more data at it, you may solve the problems that actually are puzzles, but youll only make the mysteries harder to solve, as needles of insight are buried under more and more hay. As Malcolm points out, the reason the intelligence community was unable to prevent the Sept. 11 attacks wasnt a lack of data; there was more than enough information available. So much more, in fact, that analysts were overwhelmed, unable to see the big picture or draw the necessary inferences.;Today, many of our institutions, from government to industry to education, operate on the assumption that every problem is a puzzle. All we have to do is gather enough informationperformance metrics, patterns of behavior, historical trends and so onand the solution will become evident. But thats not the world were living in. For every puzzle that can be solved with data, theres a mystery that calls for deeper understandingfor seeing things that no machine can perceive.;How can you tell a mystery from a puzzle? An e of each may be helpful. Lets say a retailer needs to figure out how much to scale its operations for the coming holiday season. To begin with, youd consider how much your own sales volume had increased during the previous years holiday peak. Now look at comparable figures for your market as a whole. Layer on the potential impact of current economic conditions compared to last year. Factor in any changes in your distribution networks and retail footprint. Make apples-to-apples comparisons for the performance of individual products this year and last year. With each additional data source, your forecast becomes more accurate. Itll never be perfect, but theres a direct correlation between data volume and insight. This is a puzzle, and it should be solved as one.;Now, a mystery. In his Synergy keynote, Malcolm donned the hat of an NBA general manager to consider the prospects of top draft picks over the first few years of their career. The data shows a clear trend: for a variety of reasons, players tend to peak statistically in their fourth year. Viewing this as a puzzle, youd collect more and more data to confirm this trend, gain confidence in its reliability, and make a practice of viewing a players fourth-year performance as his high-water mark.;Butwhat about Gordon Hayward of the Utah Jazz? Although his performance rose during his first three seasons as predicted, followed by a slump in his fourth season, it soared to new heights in his seventh season, at a time when the model would indicate likely complacency and gradual decline. Why? All the data in the world wont help you solve this mystery. Instead, youd need to go inside Haywards head and discover his renewed determination to raise his game. Unsatisfied with his performance to date, he changed his approach to preparation and competition and became one of the top players in the league.;We all want a Gordon Hayward on our team, but youre not going to find him with an algorithm. Only an e in the psychology of sportsa human onewould be able to perceive the unique passion and grit that set him apart from his peers.;Yes, machine intelligence will play a central role in the future of work. But what role will you play? What we need now are e who can perceive the nuances that machines miss. After all, the challenge facing most organizations now isnt a shortage of datawere swimming in it. Whats needed are thoughtful people who can see the reality beyond the numbers. Any good doctor knows that theres no one right answer for every patient; decisions about testing and treatment must factor in myriad considerations, such as the individuals tolerance for risk, desired quality of life or lifespan, available resources, physical condition and more. A strategy for market e must take into account not just the new geographys demographic and economic profile, but also its history, culture and language. An e search can never be conducted solely on paper; eye contact, tone of voice, and an empathic bearing can be as telling as any item on the resume.;Your role in the future of work is no longer to solve puzzles. Machines can now do it better and faster. Instead, its to recognize mysteries as they arrive, and apply the human perception and reasoning essential to solve them. Only a human e can act socially, not just operationally, guided by intuitive understanding and a tolerance for uncertainty and subjectivity. Only a human e can have the kind of complicated, intimate, sensitive, real conversations needed to solve human problems, whether for the patient on the table, the student in the classroom, or the business partner across the globe.;Thats not necessarily an easy transition to make. Many of our professions and organizations are built around solving puzzles, not mysteries, and it can be difficult to move beyond the more-data-please mentality. But it begins with the recognition that future of work will revolve around the human element no less than technology. Just as machines grow more intelligent in their own way, we need to keep developing our own human e mystery-solving skills.;Although Citrix has always had technological innovation deep in our DNA, weve never lost our focus on the people who use that technology. As we enable the future of work, we build big data analytics, AI, and machine learning into our solutionsbut we also strengthen and streamline the connections people need to apply their own intelligence. We empower people to access tools, resources and fellow humans more easily, anywhere, at any time, to learn, collaborate, brainstorm, decide and solve. Within every mystery is a new beginning, a new way forwarda new future. Its in our hands.;Tim Minahan is senior vice president and chief marketing officer (CMO) at Citrix, where he leads global marketing strategy and operations for the companys vision of securely delivering the worlds most important apps and data to enable people and businesses to work better.; This mornings guest post comes to us fromDavid Woolf, Steelcase General Manager for Integrated Technologies.

I think the insights are worth sharing with Xerox channel partners who haven considered using award nominations like this as a positive marketing opportunity. The (BBB) of Springfield, Missouri annual Torch Awards program is designed to highlight the top three most ethical companies across small, medium and large businesses. Local businesses submit their Torch Award nominations to BBB. They review and interview the nominations, and select 25 finalists. The finalists attend an awards dinner, where the top three winners receive a plaque. How Document Solutions of Springfield turned an award nomination into new business Greg has worked with Xerox since 1982, first as a Xerox direct sales rep and then as a business owner. In 1994, he and his wife Lisa took the bold step to relocate to Springfield from St. Louis where they knew no one and opened Moving and starting a new business in a smaller community where networking and relationships are critical to success was no easy task. And good ethics wasn something they set out to capitalize on. It was simply a beneficial by-product of doing the right things for their customers. As Greg tells it were the new guys and we had to figure out a way to give a personal touch in order to win new business. And then added, learn strong ethics when you grow up with Xerox. I still wear a suit and tie every day. They teach it to you and it becomes a part of everything you do. Timing definitely helped as the nominations coincided with breaking news about unethical business practices a competitor was involved in. The entire Springfield community was on alert, making ethics a hot topic when the nominations were announced. But as Greg pointed out, if they hadn already been practicing good ethics or weren already members of the BBB and other local organizations, the opportunity to turn news into new business would not have happened. Leveraging the nomination to revamp their marketing initiatives and highlight their commitment to e helped win new business. In fact, Greg attributes a total of six new customers (and growing) to their standing as a top rated ethical business. in business is the Xerox norm so, getting an award from the BBB for it is something special, says Greg. And when the honor was awarded to Document Solutions of Springfield Inc., he set out to use it in his marketing efforts. They put photos of Greg and Lisa on print advertising, brochures and the website and then centered their marketing message on community values like being family owned and providing a personal touch. Greg is a supporter of community networking and encourages other Xerox channel partners to get involved with the BBB and other programs meant to differentiate local businesses in the eyes of consumers. Put their emblems on your website and print materials to signify your good standing and participate in their programs to help drive more business. Since being recognized by the BBB, the Springfield Chamber of Commerce also highlighted Document Solutions of Springfield Inc., in a recent . Greg wants other Xerox channel partners to be aware of the opportunities awards bring. has different marketing, he says, can always compete on price so it important to stand on the difference Xerox products and ethics bring to the sale and winning awards in these areas lets the public speak for you in a way that advertising can. Channel Partner tip - build stronger relationships by joining local biz communities In my role at Xerox as the Agent Business Manager, I seen the positive impact this nomination has had on Greg and Lisa business. I encourage all Xerox channel partners, to take heed of Greg advice and look for ways to strengthen local community ties by joining local business networks and communities such as the Better Business Bureau. Whilst Greg and his team never set out to get an ethical award nomination, now that they have, it has made a big difference. I congratulate Greg and the Document Solutions of Springfield team for the nomination and for how they have used it to win new business.

Today print buyers often know little about print. They are rarely interested in the processes. However, many printing companies tend to bombard their connections with technical print information and pictures of their equipment. Worse still, many companies also spend a lot of time talking about their cheap prices. The easiest way is to know your audience and understand what is of real interest to them. To achieve this successfully it is best to focus on certain target audiences. Trying to be all things to everyone is hard on social media (as it is in all sales activities). So pick one or two target audiences and focus on trends and information that are of value to them. For instance, you may be trying to attract medium-sized agencies. Some of the things that I have typically found of interest to these organisations include: This sounds great in theory but how do we manage it in practice? Here are six ways to provide the right content to your social media connections: These days it is not hard to find relevant statistics for your audience. The rise of infographics has hugely increased the number of statistics! A quick statistic makes an ideal tweet or LinkedIn status update. It can also be the inspiration for a blog piece (see below). It is fine to share interesting content by other people. Make sure that you credit them and provide a link back to the original source. In a longer post, you would ideally write a few lines about the original piece and why you find it interesting. If you do this, people will be delighted that you have spread the word about their content. In turn, your social media stream will become known as a great source of relevant and interesting content for your target audiences. If you are a Xerox customer using their production printing technology, you have free access to the . This includes a library of content, including sample social media posts. One of the most compelling pieces of social media content is a good case study. It is good practice to write up successful projects that you have carried out for clients. These should focus on the results you helped a client gain for their business. Here is a . Prospects like to see original content. With this in mind it is worth thinking about starting your own blog. If you decide to go down this route, plan for the future. The world is full of blogs that were started enthusiastically but didn last very long! Set up an editorial timetable for the first few months. Also, make sure that you are confident about writing this sort of content and can set aside the necessary time to do this. Another option is to leave the content creation to a third party. Ideally, you will find someone with a knowledge of our industry. However, they should also be able to demonstrate a knowledge of how to write blog pieces it is not as simple as it seems!

[The future is] about sustainable development, not just throwing away the analogue bathwater for the sake of it. Photo courtesy of Anders Sorman-Nilsson. After a stint at a marketing consultancy, he branched off on his own, founding the think tank, , in 2005 and consulting big-name companies on how to adapt to change in an increasingly world. (Clients have included Apple, Cisco and Xerox.) The issue hits close to home. In 1917, Anders great-grandfather started a clothier business in Stockholm. He prided himself in knowing the first names and family history of his clients and believed in personal, face-to-face connections. Nearly a century later, the family business still e, but Anders parents are struggling to connect with clients in a changing world, battling online retailers who offer convenience and cheaper prices, even if the items are lower quality. Anders believes the key to his family business survival is merging the old and the new: Finding a way to hold on to the traditions that made his great-grandfather successful while adapting to the technology that modern customers e. These days, the Australian-Swedish futurist, innovation strategist and author divides his time between consulting and speaking engagements, focusing on the concept of the convergence of digital and analogue. Anders recently talked about how he helps companies achieve the right balance between the two. Digital disruption is a combination of what happening in e communication and technology as much as anything. It comes down to a communications challenge. When you driving digitization initiatives, you might see several of the owner partners not really adopting the technology. What kind of message does that send to the rest of that organization? You want to make the complex simple through technology but sometimes, there a very heavy resistance. A typical e of this is a client of mine who had a fantastic YouTube campaign. An advertising company came in and really worked with their employment banks, spoke about their workplace culture of nice things that win the hearts and minds no one was able to view it because YouTube was blocked on their server. I still have companies send me documents in 2003 Microsoft PowerPoint. Eleven years later, they haven upgraded the way they should have. Large organizations can get very much stuck in being slow to move, and trying to protect market share and not being able to adopt the latest technology. On the other hand, startups sometimes move too fast and often find themselves on the edge instead of the edge. Sometimes they too early and might not go mainstream. Let me see if I can answer this way. Despite all of this rush to digitize and find the latest for as cheap as possible, vinyl record sales are up 20 percent. Why is that when we have Spotify or digital downloads? You don remember those like you remember your first vinyl record or your first cassette. Digital can sort of seem ephemeral, but it doesn necessarily touch the heart. Timelessness means timeliness, old meets new, modern meets traditional it quite important to combine the timeless wisdom of older staff with that digital combination. When you get that mix right, magic can happen. My parents are finally understanding that digital is not a threat. Even if the business doesn survive and thrive, at least there will be a nice digital playbook of everything we stand for. It time to stop just singing in the shower hoping people will come into the shop it about retaining the digital communications. As you look to the future, remember the past as well. It about sustainable development, not just throwing away the analogue bathwater for the sake of it. For startups, it looks a little different. They might be able to brand and digitally engage. You have a great website, but are you able to win friends and influence? Some of these trends seem sort of mutually e, but there a great mantra by F. Scott Fitzgerald: test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function. Maybe says analogue and digital are not mutually e, but can co-e. We have to look at how the digital makes the complex simple in some ways. An e: The New York consumer has really sought the e of farm to table. We can read on the menu that the fish we about to consume has been line caught within 50 kilometers. But can it be verified? With digital traceability, nowadays it not just farm to table or farm to fork, but farm to iPhone. You can scan the rib-eye steak in a supermarket, through the QR code and see its whole lifecycle. That brings this whole craving of farm to fork into the digital realm, where digital storytelling can really emerge. Hi! Quick question that entirely off topic.

It doesn matter whether those processes connect customer-facing engagements or internal support functions. One delay, one error, one missed step drives down quality. Even worse, it can cost you a customer forever. Enterprise leaders recognize the importance of adopting digital ways of working. A finds that top performing companies take advantage of digital innovation. In other , 25 percent of CEOs cite technology-related issues in their top business priorities, while two-thirds say their enterprises are involved in industry-level digital initiatives. your digital transformation objectives or initiatives, moving away from paper is a top priority. Digitization of paper-based processes is a fundamental enabler of digital transformation for traditional businesses. Going paperless is easier said than done, especially for large, established organizations. For one thing, there are the cost and time to digitize entrenched end-to-end workflows. The return on investment is appealing, but first that investment must be financed and resourced. And even before getting to deployment, you need to factually understand what you dealing with. It takes time, e and technology to map customer and employee journeys in the conte of business processes. In the meantime, organizations may have to manage hybrid environments of non-digitized and partially digitized processes. If it sounds challenging, it is. hurdle for digital crusaders is that even the most thorough of digitization efforts can account for all e in a process. In an ideal world, every structured, automated process is defined by a set events that follow one after another without mishap. In the actual world, stuff happens. We well know to e deviations or to a process. If, for e, the first workflow step is completion of an electronic form, the assumption is that it will be filled out fully and accurately. Any error or omission signals an e to the process, and it still common to fall back on paper-based workarounds when an e is encountered. E that need paper intervention throw up constant barriers to full process digitization. of continued paper use persist, even in organizations heavily invested in digitization. Some paper holdouts stem from choosing paper in unstructured and personal workflows, because available digital approaches are clumsy or complex. These personal and impromptu uses of paper tend to fall outside organizational digitization strategies. In unstructured processes, whether people are collaborating with others or working on individual tasks, each has their own personal or team-based ways of working, which may involve paper. Personal workflows may e within more structured processes whenever someone adds a step of their own. For e, you may ask a colleague to review a document, even though the defined process doesn call for a review. Signatures or sign offs frequently generate a paper step. If you need a reviewer to initial a document, there usually a print job involved. digitized, structured process sometimes generates or transient paper (meaning not permanently associated with the workflow or tracked for print cost) whenever anyone adds a paper-based personal step. For e, an HR manager prints r that have been submitted electronically, works through them on paper to make acceptance and rejection decisions, then enters those decisions into the recruitment system to trigger the ne step in the process and throws the printed r away. these entrenched realities mean we must reconcile to workplaces that still use paper and its associated inefficiencies for some time to come? Accepting or ignoring these conditions doesn solve the problem. It creates more. What then can be done to eliminate or minimize these barriers and speed up your digital transformation? One thing to consider is to paper that require no process re-engineering or special digitization initiatives or training to launch. Such tools simply facilitate paperless working for tasks that typically cause people to still choose paper. Additionally, by combining digital alternatives solutions with usage analytics, organizations can tap into data to help decide where to invest further in workflow optimization, digitization and automation. Armed with this knowledge, your enterprise is ready to move forward towards work-changing digital transformation. And that change that matters. [] Para leer el art completo acceda aqu.

With the advent of new technology, the amount of paper we use at work may finally have started to fall, but it not doing so at any great rate. So, why aren we meeting the paperless goals proposed decades ago? Darren Cassidy, Managing Director, Xerox U.K. E the main reasons that people print, can point to the barriers that prevent office workers from taking up fully digital processes. Is it possible for organizations to reduce printing by removing the barriers either completely or at least partially? Or, are the barriers insurmountable? Barriers do e, and paper has a few affordances that are genuinely difficult to replicate digitally with current or near-future technology. Yet most of what we like about paper we can replicate digitally if the will e to create new enterprise solutions. The disruptive innovation of mobile and cloud technologies provide an opportunity to change behavior in today workplace. But convincing people to transform their paper-based processes requires engaging properly with employees about change and ensuring that new processes are as easy and intuitive as possible. Whether through necessity, preference or a combination of both, people in the workplace today print documents in order to: Until recently there were good reasons that people might prefer reading documents on paper than on screen; portability, readability and annotation. The tablet changes the game. We need to take advantage of device proliferation to make document availability much more instantaneous and intuitive. Imagine a world in which, just as the button is ubiquitous, so is the button. Imagine if, from the user perspective, tapping that button makes the selected document instantaneously available to every device owned by the user, and readable within their preferred reading app. In an ideal world, where on-screen annotating is a universal capability that is as easy and convenient as possible, will any tendencies remain to annotate on paper? It likely there will be some, but only for very specific situations. Digital annotation will become the norm when digital scribing techniques become very similar to writing in that they barely interfere with the act of reading. Even in an industry such as banking that has very high levels of electronic transactions, signature capture is still heavily paper-based, as an InfoTrends study found. For e, more than 70 percent of respondents said they still rely on paper for capturing signatures for loans and savings/investments. Electronic authorization takes root when organizations fully digitize all of their business processes that involve signing and authorization and make the e-signing process simple for users. Digital has long been the preferred avenue for sharing. But the physical attributes of a printed page can make content really stand out, particularly as digital sharing becomes more and more prominent. The technology to help us store documents digitally is maturing rapidly. We already seeing industrial-scale scanners with intelligent character recognition and electronic systems for applying inde and metadata for subsequent retrieval. The potential upshots of mining, literally, tons of paper data into electronic systems are enormous. This is the promise of Document Data, and it perhaps the single biggest driver of changing print behavior within your organization. As is becoming clear in any workplace, the consumerization of information technology including the meteoric rise of smartphone and tablet technology, and the world of apps and cloud-based services has introduced new capabilities, behaviors and attitudes to our lives. It still early days for these disruptive innovations: Worldwide, smartphone shipments first e PCs only at the end of 2011. The modern tablet, which is the best readily available technology for replicating paper-like e, barely e before the launch of the iPad in 2010 so the market is still very much in its infancy. The tidal wave of change has only just begun to be felt. But the trend of people using multiple devices, and e a high level of computing functionality when away from a wired workstation, will become much more strongly embedded. For e, IDC predicts that 37 percent of the worldwide workforce will be mobile by 2015 and Gartner predicts that by 2014, 90 percent of organizations will support corporate applications on personal devices. The disruptive innovation of mobile technologies invites the shift of document usage from paper-based to electronic. While paper has a few affordances that are difficult to replicate digitally with current or near-future technology, most of what we like about paper can now be achieved digitally. E the way employees handle specific, daily tasks, and reengineer them so that the steps can be achieved electronically. The key is to make the processes as easy and convenient as possible, for both knowledge workers and those less technology-literate. The behaviors of reading, annotating, sharing, authorizing, saving are common to anyone who uses documents a lot in their work, and certainly to knowledge workers. But equally they will manifest in specific ways in just about every step in a structured business process that touches people. A human resources process, or a product lifecycle management process, for e, will require people to read, comment on, add to, organize, make decisions about, distribute, authorize and save specific types of document as specific points in the process. Organizations that take on the less-paper challenge have much to gain. Certainly change has risks and can be disruptive, even painful. But there a reason people have looked forward to the less-paper office for so many decades: The promise of a more efficient, productive, collaborative and sustainable world of work. CIO Today UK.)

I found, as an office worker, that it is challenging at times to view multiple documents, either for comparison or transfer of information inbetween or among them, mainly due to the size limitations of the monitor. I often end up printing one of them and viewing the other on the screen. Hi, To be able to annotate is indeed a function needed when moving from paper to digital.

Not just X as in Xerox, but X as in User E or UX, Customer E or CX and Digital Transformation or DX. And surprisingly, at the intersection of these three trends, we find yet one more acronym MPS, aka Managed Print Services. Now that managed print and document services have moved up the enterprise value chain, you find clear connections to processes, documents and users that impact UX, DX and CX. And because there impact, there opportunity to influence it. In each case, MPS can support your UX, CX and DX goals. Let break it down X by X, if you will. Then we connect the dots between each X and the supporting MPS benefits and even down to the device capabilities, because more than you might realize. When customer touch points involve documents and processes, intelligent multifunction devices contribute to a positive e. You may think using an office printer or scanner is no big deal, and it shouldn be. But if you not making each user interaction productive and cost-effective, it becomes a big deal. How often does a bad print or scan e impact productivity somewhere in your business every day? That a loss. A good user e at the MFP saves hours of accumulated employee time. Imagine even doing something as skilled and complicated as translations at your office MFP! ( ) and route confidential documents automatically with speed and security. The consistent, quality UX through a balance of hardware technology and software capability. Nowhere is this better demonstrated than in the user interface, which resets the bar to include capacitive, 5-inch color touch screens. The interfaces offer the . Task-focused apps share a common look and feel and reduce the steps needed to complete repetitive jobs, effectively decreasing on task. The interface layout clearly guides users through any job from start to finish and uses fewer steps to complete even the most complex jobs. The new standard for office devices includes capabilities that: With newfound time and more support from their office technology, knowledge workers can focus on the high-value stuff. Intelligent devices become assistants that help employees, instead of slowing them down.

I learned (perhaps in a bit too much detail) how sensitive our perception is to visual differences. Contrast, or how we visually perceive our world, is determined by the differences in brightness and color of the objects we see. As it turns out, people are pretty good at seeing subtle differences. I recently had the opportunity to travel to Ethiopia and see the great work that is doing there. It was also a real-world study in contrast. As a first time traveler to any developing country, and to Africa in particular, I had some e. Sights, sounds, and smells were unfamiliar, mostly different in the ways I anticipated. This might have been the e of it had I simply been visiting as a tourist. However, I had the opportunity to go beyond the hotel compound and learn more about this wonderful country and the Ethiopian people. The group I worked with go where they are most needed. Once there, they work to transform or build schools for children that otherwise have very limited access to education. They make sure there is access to clean drinking water. They build toilets separated for boys and girls. They build classrooms, hire teachers, and deliver programs in early childhood education, literacy, adolescent development, and health and nutrition. They teach the children and the entire community. all, they make a difference in the lives of their fellow Ethiopians. The schools in Ethiopia are still much different than the schools most people are used to. There are no school buses. Children walk a long way for the chance to learn. The location is remote. There is a single slate for every student rather than lockers stuffed with notebooks. But in the bigger picture, the difference is not so great. While there, I sat in on a PTA meeting. I witnessed the local people and communities working together because they know the value education provides to their children. I met teachers that have become part of the community where they teach. These teachers care about their students and know how to help them learn vital skills. And as I saw kids walking to take their year-end tests, the e to learn was as easy to see as their smiling faces. By the end of the week, I had spoken with many people, and had a chance to introduce more than 50 people in the field office to QwikSolver, a problem solving method we use at Xerox that is focused on continuous improvement. What wasn new was their desire to learn, improve, and offer even more to the children they serve. With apologies to the imaging science field, visual contrast really doesn let you see the whole picture. Sometimes you have to see and e the world. no matter where you go, people are always looking for new and better ways to improve their lives and the lives of those around them. What a wonderful initiative. What an inspiration John is to other colleagues around the globe. Your last paragraph is absolutely true and never a truer sentence was uttered than is the best education a person can receive! I am e interested in QwikSolver as continuous improvement is one of our core values at Fuji Xerox Australia! How wonderful to have the opportunity to back to the community in such a tangible and engaging way.a whole year! Love being a part of Xerox multi-national company.we really do live by our values and am a strong corporate and community citizen! Iris and Pamela, Thank you so much for your kind words. I certainly have been given a wonderful opportunity and am hopeful that I am bringing some new ways of helping them deliver against an inspiring mission. Thank you Conor. I couldn agree more everywhere want to accomplish great things and help others. While grateful for the amazing opportunity to focus on that for the year, I reminded that it takes only a little time to lend your talents to helping others. I hope to find a way to do that every day.continuous improvement! John, you truly are making a difference and making great connections which will last you a life time. Redefining, continous improvement. Bravo sir!

Although iPads, Chromebooks, and online learning applications are revolutionizing the education vertical, the paperless classroom still sits on the distant horizon. In the meantime, cash-strapped schools and universities, as well as their time-constrained staffs and technology-savvy students, have to find creative ways to deal with paper and address their evolving document management needs. (MFPs) enable education institutions to save time and money with innovative workflow solutions for digitizing and generating paper content. Xerox channel partners can help education clients select and custom-tailor MFP applications, for e, reducing wait time at devices, streamlining print jobs, and making paper document scanning a snap. By leveraging the power and fle of Xerox MFPs and workflow solutions, channel partners can help educational institutions streamline their document management and printing systems. Using customizable app templates and developing applications of their own, channel partners can simplify print/copy jobs dramatically, minimizing the time educators spend waiting at the device and minimizing the volume of wasted consumables. Xerox MFPs can connect to learning systems such as Moodle or \'Blackboard Learn\' to streamline workflows Channel partners can create automated workflows to improve collaboration and communication among teachers and administrators, and deploy data capture solutions to reduce reliance on paper. In addition, integrating printing and scanning workflows with other technology systems helps educators do their jobs more efficiently and avoids system hampering productivity. Tying together customized Xerox solutions and online learning management systems such as or , for instance, allows educators to fully leverage available educational tools. And given today reliance on mobile devices in classrooms and on campuses, linking those devices with document management systems is imperative.

The company also previewed the ne upcoming release of its flagship ; platform, acquired earlier this year through the ;. To date, more than 2,000 cloud providers around the world have chosen ; as a key platform for building their cloud businesses, including 4 of the top 5 largest public clouds in production (;). Today\'s news further e the ; vision for helping cloud providers of all sizes and business models build clouds the way the world\'s most successful clouds are built and transform them into profitable and productive businesses. ; As the industry transitions from the PC Era to the Cloud Era, the cloud services market is ;, comprised of thousands of providers of all sizes. These providers will offer a vast array of cloud services including business and productivity applications, gaming, consumer collaboration services, managed desktops, data storage, business continuity services, and infrastructure as a service. In order to grow to cloud-scale while maintaining sufficient margins and quality customer service, cloud providers need to make it as easy and fast for customers to add new services, change options, add users, and manage their accounts on their own, at any time. Some providers attempt to build their own customer portals, but soon discover the comple and costs of maintaining the platform and integrating it with new service offerings. Ultimately, this hurts their time to market with new services, and decreases their fle as a business. ; The new Citrix CloudPortal product line eases those challenges for providers of all sizes and business models by simplifying and automating the commerce and customer service aspects of operating a cloud business, including on-boarding, account management, billing and metering, customer service and service provisioning. Besides making it easier and more cost effective for cloud providers to grow their businesses, CloudPortal empowers cloud customers with self-service control, reducing management costs for providers, while improving the overall service e for customers. CloudPortal also adds a rich set of pre-built provider-focused solutions for popular cloud offering, including IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service), DaaS (Desktops-as-a-Service), SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) and WaaS (Windows-as-a-Service). By partnering with ;, public and private cloud providers alike can leverage their core competencies in areas like applications, infrastructure, and data management to build differentiated, high value services that can be managed from a simple online business portal (see attached graphic of Citrix CloudPortal and how it fits into the Citrix Cloud Platforms product line). ; The new Citrix CloudPortal product line has two editions that enable providers to automate the commerce of their clouds and dramatically increase their admin-to-customer leverage. Both solutions were designed in close collaboration with some of the world\'s most successful cloud providers, and are already in production in clouds around the world. With today\'s launch, ; is now making both editions broadly available to all customers worldwide: ; Before providers can build successful businesses, they need to ensure they are building on a platform designed for the economics, elasticity and scale of the cloud. Citrix CloudStack is designed to do e that. CloudStack is not a traditional enterprise server virtualization platform with cloud-like management layers on top. It was designed from the ground up as an open, multi-hypervisor platform to help customers build public and private clouds the way the world\'s largest and most successful clouds are built simple, automated, elastic, scalable and efficient. ; At Synergy Barcelona this week, ; will also preview its upcoming Citrix CloudStack 3, the first release of the market leading cloud platform under the Citrix brand. The new edition of CloudStack sets a new standard across the board, helping cloud providers get to market quickly with highly scalable, highly reliable services designed and optimized for cloud delivery. New capabilities include: ; ""Many of the largest and most successful clouds in the world have chosen ; technology to build their cloud businesses. While others seek to turn cloud providers into commodity suppliers, our open approach helps enable them to highlight their unique skills and competencies. Our new CloudPortal product line is a perfect e of that, enabling customers to quickly and easily transform general purpose cloud infrastructure into successful, innovative, profitable businesses."" ; ""CloudPortal Services Manager has been a cornerstone of our business model and the key to success for our service relationship with customers. It not only eases the on-boarding process, but helps us innovate faster and easier.

I have a lot of people with whom I am connected with but have never engaged. These connections are often in market sectors that are of no interest to me. It would probably be a waste of time to try and develop these connections. Many trainers say that there can be a value in all connections. But, these days, it is not difficult to find people that you want to connect and engage with. So here a more important question: Naturally, we all have connections that we value because they are friends, industry colleagues, business network connections or clients. However, if we are using social media to grow our sales, then there is another type of connection that we should also value. These are sales prospects. Naturally, some prospects are more valuable than others! In my recent article, we talked about taking social media connections offline and into more direct communication channels. This can be a time-consuming task that takes effort. You can go down this route with all your social media connections. There are some simple ways to work out which connections you should spend the most time on. I going to focus on three strategies to help decide which prospects you should spend direct sales time. I would recommend that you follow these strategies in the order that I have set out in this article. So let go straight to the first one. If a social media contact is interested in what you are saying, they will engage with you. Here are some ways to check for engagement: It is easy to keep a check on this activity: all platforms have a notifications feed which keep you up to date with all engagement. You can also set up e-mail notifications for most types of engagement. However, I prefer to check the feeds. This avoids e-mail overload. It also allows you to review all engagement in one go. E-mail updates can mean you focus on isolated updates. Once you have a list of engaged followers, you can move to the ne step. Make sure that your connection represents the type of company that you want to work with. Also make sure that they are the right role to be able to progress a buying relationship. Remember, sometimes brand feeds engage in order to try and get more coverage on social media. This is particularly common on Twitter. Also, some people like to engage in social media conversations for fun, rather with a serious business goal. Once you managed this stage, you are ready for the final task. Taking relationships offline requires the right tactics. In my ne article I going to show you four effective ways to transition your social media connections into the real world. In the meantime you can concentrate on the first two strategies. Your social network is full of potential customers. Are you taking full advantage? Set aside two time slots of 15 minutes in the coming week. Use these to measure engagement from your prospects. Make a list of your most engaged connections. Then go and check their profiles to make sure they are the right fit. You soon have a list of worthwhile prospects to approach directly. You never know when circumstances might change. A connection that holds little value today may have a need for your services in the future and suddenly become very valuable. So, if someone is following you, stay connected. Keep sending them your content. You may end up with a warm prospect that you want to make a direct approach to.

She had to be good, because the shoot for our commercials was challenging and she did a great job! The actress in the simplicity at work ad is also quite stylish/professional. Any chance you might know the brand name of the white blouse she is wearing and possibly where it is sold? I would like to get one for my wife. Thank you. Thanks for the question, Fred. I asked around, and the best I got was agreement that our actress is indeed a stylish dresser. The agencies get their wardrobes from a variety of stores, so I suppose you have to shop around just like the pros do. Good luck locating the perfect blouse for your wife I hope she loves it as much as you do! Thank you Barbara Basney for letting us know about Catherine Kresge, she is absolutely amazing, and the perfect choice for the Xerox brand. Sharp, smart lady, selling smart, sharp products! It appears that Xerox has been making the right HR decisions for years. I have two dear high school friends (Dennis & Janice Norton-husband and wife), just wonderful people, who have worked for your company for years. John Vaishav, I was wondering the same thing, I even goggled is the actress that does the new commercials which brought me to this page. I a big fan of Xerox, the Norton, and now Ms. Kresge! These are fantastic, can someone please ensure these get shown in Europe and UK, I am constantly e to people that we are no longer a product/hardware firm. No longer a product/hardware firm only! E commercial. I have only seen the one shot in a hospital (possibly a lab), e showing toll booths. love the brevity and subtle gravitas. was this particular ad filmed? Glad you like the commercial, Candace. The scene was filmed at a toll facility in New York state, but nobody can recall the town.

Many people do not see how a blog creates business. These people are absolutely right to have these doubts. Sometimes good blogs are simply ignored. As we saw in my , there is not a lot of point in having a blog without readers. We looked at three ways in which you can promote your blog more effectively. But even if you create a popular blog, you still face a problem. Most people will find your blog on social media. But it one thing to momentarily pause on a blog to read an interesting piece, and something completely different to remember to keep coming back and visiting it. If you want to create customers from your blog, it important to have regular readers who value your content. So what the difference between a newsletter and a blog? The good news is that they both can use the same content. However, they are sent out in very different ways. The blog is published. You put it on your website and anyone can come and read it. The newsletter is sent out, typically as an e-mail, to people who have specifically requested to receive it. Blog readers and newsletter readers are typically at very different points on the buyer journey. The blog reader is someone who may never have heard of your company before. Or they may have a passing interest. The newsletter reader is aware of your company and blog. They are sufficiently interested to have committed to receiving information from you regularly. They are potential customers. That means that you should encourage readers of blogs and newsletters to take action in different ways, as you will see. Finally, as it sent out to specific readers, the success of a newsletter is much more measurable. So there are many reasons why having people subscribe to your newsletter is much more desirable than having them as casual readers of your blog. The most important thing is to give people a reason to sign up for your information. Promising people news from our company is not enough in today era of information overload. Instead, you should give people a useful resource in return for signing up. For instance, if you sign up to my newsletter, you will receive an e-book about how to use social media to sell print (you can find out more and click through at the bottom of this article). There are four ways to promote the newsletter and your sign-up incentive: Your current customers will often be happy to become regular readers. It also a great way for you to stay front of mind for these clients, as well as building e engagement. Make sure that every time you talk to your customers who have not signed up that you remind them about the list. Tell them about the incentive and why your information should be of interest to them. Ask if you can sign them up. The end of every blog article should have a call to action. Encourage people to sign up to your newsletter list. You can even embed a sign-up form at the bottom of the article so they don have to search for it. Make it as easy for them as possible. Make sure you promote your newsletter on your website. Most pages should have a click-through to a sign-up form. You can also look into widget plug-ins, such as having a mini-sign-up form in the side bar or at the bottom of key pages. Make sure you do not send out lots of unsolicited promotional e-mails about your newsletter. This is regarded as spam. You can e severe consequences if you send out spam e-mail. However, do think about mentioning your newsletter as part of your regular e-mail signature. It is vital that you comply with legislation regarding list mailing. . There one other question to cover when it comes to running a successful newsletter. That what we look at in my ne article.

The US dollar equivalent of the closing price on each of the dealing days referred to above is calculated using a market currency e rate prevailing at the time.;ADS stands for American Depositary Share. ADR stands for American Depositary Receipt. An ADR is a certificate that evidences ADSs (though the terms ADR and ADS are often used interchangeably). ADSs are listed on the NYSE under the symbols RDS.A and RDS.B. Each ADS represents two ordinary shares, two ordinary A Shares in the case of RDS.A or two ordinary B Shares in the case of RDS.B.;The Reference ADS Price equals the Reference Share Price of the two A Shares underlying each new A ADS.;RDS provides shareholders with a choice to receive dividends in cash or in shares via a Scrip Dividend Programme (the Programme).;Under the Programme shareholders can increase their shareholding in RDS by choosing to receive new shares instead of cash dividends, if approved by the Board. Only new A Shares will be issued under the Programme, including to shareholders who currently hold B Shares.;Joining the Programme may offer a tax advantage in some countries compared with receiving cash dividends. In particular, dividends paid out as shares will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax (currently 15 per cent) and will not generally be ta on receipt by a UK shareholder or a Dutch shareholder.;Shareholders who elect to join the Programme will increase the number of shares held in RDS without having to buy e shares in the market, thereby avoiding associated dealing costs. Shareholders who do not join the Programme will continue to receive in cash any dividends approved by the Board.;Shareholders who held only B Shares and joined the Programme are reminded they will need to make a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of their new A Shares if they wish to join the Programme in respect of such new shares. However, this is only necessary if the shareholder has not previously made a Scrip Dividend Election in respect of any new A Shares issued.;For further information on the Programme, including how to join if you are eligible, please refer to the appropriate publication available ;.;Europe: + 31 70 377 4540;North America: +1 832 337 2034;International: +44 207 934 5550;Americas: +1 713 241 4544;The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate entities.

Net revenues increased 25% in the first quarter of 2015 to $805 million compared with net revenues of $642 million in the prior year\'s period. On a currency neutral basis, net revenues increased 27% compared with the prior year\'s period. Net income decreased 13% in the first quarter of 2015 to $12 million compared with $14 million in the prior year\'s period, inclusive of costs related to the previously announced acquisitions of Endomondo and MyFitnessPal during the first quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2015 were $0.05 compared with $0.06 per share in the prior year\'s period.; quarter apparel net revenues increased 21% to $555 million compared with $459 million in the same period of the prior year, driven primarily by new product introductions in baselayer and training. First quarter footwear net revenues increased 41% to $161 million from $114 million in the prior year\'s period, highlighted by e SpeedForm running offerings as well as the introduction of the Curry One basketball shoe. First quarter accessories net revenues increased 23% to $63 million from $52 million in the prior year\'s period. Direct-to-Consumer net revenues, which represented 25% of total net revenues for the first quarter, grew 21% year-over-year. International net revenues, which represented 12% of total net revenues for the first quarter, grew 74% year-over-year.; Plank, Chairman and CEO of Under Armour, Inc., stated, ""We reached an important milestone to start 2015 with our 20th straight quarter above 20% net revenue growth. This represents five years of consistently e the demands of our athletes and just as importantly, anticipating what those demands will be ne. While the 25% growth achieved in the first quarter was a great start to the year, we are even more e with the foundation we are establishing for future growth. Within our Connected Fitness platform, we closed our two acquisitions of Endomondo and MyFitnessPal to create the world\'s largest digital health and fitness community. We have already added over 10 million unique registered users to our platform since our initial February announcement, bringing the total Connected Fitness community to over 130 million unique registered users. We opened a 30,000 square foot Brand House store on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago, while also debuting our first stores in Brazil and the Middle East which contributed to the 74% international growth for the quarter. We e tremendous demand for our new SpeedForm Gemini running shoe and the Curry One basketball shoe with even bigger things to come in these categories. And in our largest product category, Apparel, we crossed 20% growth for the 22nd consecutive quarter. These are powerful engines that will help ensure the Brand remains firmly entrenched as the leading growth company in our industry.""; margin for the first quarter of 2015 was unchanged at 46.9%, primarily reflecting favorable product margins in apparel and footwear offset by the impacts of higher air freight and foreign e rates. Selling, general and administrative e as a percentage of net revenues were 43.5% in the first quarter of 2015 compared with 42.7% in the prior year\'s period, primarily reflecting costs associated with the two acquisitions, including $6.3 million of one-time deal-related costs. First quarter operating income increased 3% to $28 million compared with $27 million in the prior year\'s period. ; and cash equivalents increased 29% to $232 million at March 31, 2015 compared with $180 million at March 31, 2014.

Total debt increased to $677 million at March 31, 2015 compared with $152 million at March 31, 2014, primarily reflecting borrowing to fund the two Connected Fitness acquisitions.; Company had previously anticipated 2015 net revenues of appro $3.76 billion, representing growth of 22% over 2014, and 2015 operating income in the range of $397 million to $407 million, representing growth of 12% to 15% over 2014. Based on current visibility, the Company e 2015 net revenues of appro $3.78 billion, representing growth of 23% over 2014 and 2015 operating income in the range of $400 million to $408 million, representing growth of 13% to 15% over 2014. The 2015 guidance continues to reflect the net dilutive impact from the Connected Fitness acquisitions, including one-time deal-related costs, as well as the impact of the strong dollar negatively impacting our operating margin within our international businesses.;. Plank concluded, ""We are off to a great start in 2015 and have several powerful stories unfolding in the current quarter. We are incredibly proud that Under Armour athlete Jordan Spieth captured the Green Jacket in record-setting fashion at The Masters last week. At just 21, Jordan is already firmly entrenched on the global sports stage and we look to support Jordan throughout his career winning major championships as he adds to his legacy. Following our 2014 e into Brazil and the recent opening of our first Brand House store in-country, we look to accelerate our positioning in this important market with our signing of one of the most popular and successful clubs in Brazil, So Paulo Futebol Clube. Building off the success of our SpeedForm platform, we are currently debuting cleated models in both American and global football, including a boot worn by one of our newest athletes, Memphis Depay, who has proven to be one of the most e young football players in the world and at only 21 years old has the potential to become one of the most e players in the beautiful game.

b'https://digitalprinting.blogs.xerox.com/2017/01/16/stand-out-in-a-crowd-how-to-get-customers-to-notice-you/',12,14,114.277,3,144.176,2,7,27,1020,33,1,"b'This was the opening line of a sales call that I received when I was the print purchaser at a major magazine publishing company. It was a great way to grab my attention. After all, the sales person was doing e the opposite of what I would e. Most other printing companies that approached me were desperate to print my magazines! This was a great e of . It certainly ensured that the sales person got a little more time on the phone with me. Had I received a standard opening line, I would have most likely not taken the call any further. Pattern interrupt is a very useful tool for a sales person. Pattern interrupt is when you do something differently from what is e of you. If a lawyer suddenly started singing to you in a meeting, that would be a very e e of pattern interrupt! However, you would be very likely to remember that lawyer for a long time. In the same way, sales people are more likely to be remembered and get engagement if they practice pattern interrupt. It can be effective to use pattern interrupt in the actual words of the message, as I showed you at the beginning of this article. However, it is possible to get even better results by using pattern interrupt in your communication channels. Most of today sales people try and contact their prospects by using phone and e-mail. But that is what buyers are used to. They will typically leave their voicemail on. They are skilled at deleting most sales e-mails without actually reading them. A sales person that concentrates on phone and e-mail is going to have to work very hard to get many dialogues going. It is much easier to contact buyers through other channels, where they are not yet used to being sold to. You can start using my first suggestion as soon as you have a prospect cell phone number. Buyers are far less used to receiving te than e-mails. E-mails get deleted. Te get read. A te may well be from a friend or family member. So buyers will check their phones to see whom a te was from. They are used to replying to te as a matter of course. So they are much more likely to reply to you. The same thing happens on the ne communication channel. We are all used to seeing a lot of content on social media. But one-to-one interaction is a lot more rare. People often really appreciate it when their social media network engages with them. Again, they usually don see this as a typical sales channel. I have had great success in reaching out to prospects through direct messaging on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. Once you have established a dialogue, it time to continue the strategy of pattern interrupt. In today busy world, it is hard for people to find the space for meetings. , the time to and from meetings is not the best use of a sales person day. Suggesting a Skype call to a prospect is a bit different. It shows them that you are busy and do not have the time to dedicate to a traditional meeting. That makes the prospect see you differently. In addition, if you want a prospect to have a factory tour, you can walk them round your facility with a video camera. You do not have to persuade them to take time out of their schedule to physically visit you. Finally, the messaging system on Skype is another good pattern interrupt communication channel. Younger buyers are becoming increasingly used to using these channels. They often actually prefer sales people who use these forms of communication. They only become invasive if a buyer has e a preference for you not to use a particular channel. Make a commitment to yourself. Use just one of these communication channels during the ne week. Test it out and see what results it gets you. I sure that they will be more effective than the phone or e-mail. You be standing out to your prospects, just like the sales person who didn want to print my magazines stood out to me.

Returning to the site of his lone win of the season, Logano still needs a victory to qualify for the upcoming Playoffs. Logano spoke about what is at stake the ne two days with media members Friday morning. , I think it is the best looking paint scheme I have ever had on a race car. The timing couldn't be better to have the American Red Cross on it. I am so thankful for Shell to give the car to the American Red Cross in this time of need. We saw what happened down in the Houston area and the devastation that is there and also looking in the future the ne few days of what Florida looks like could possibly happen there. Obviously we need all hands on deck. If we are able to help out in any little way we should. It is what we should do as contributing members of our society. We should be thinking with our heart at this point. There are a lot of innocent people getting hit hard by these storms lately. Thoughts and prayers mean a lot as well but donating your time and resources to these communities is so large at this point. For Shell to give the car up to American Red Cross to help drive awareness to what is going on and hopefully drive more funds down to those areas is ultra important to me and hopefully everybody else as well. penalty is the penalty whether you have a win or not. It maybe didn affect him as much. He might say something different after the first round of the playoffs and he wishes he had those five point. I don know. That can affect his whole season as well. We had the opportunity to win another race and we still have one more. Then we might say it wasn as big a deal, we might say the same thing you just said about the 11 car. I think the penalty is the penalty and the fact we haven won another race since then is why it affects us differently. will be huge for a lot of different reasons. We are in a do-or-die situation. Anytime you can win a race in that situation, there is no better feeling than that. Also returning here after our win in the spring and obviously the drama that followed, it would be very nice to be able to get back in victory lane and prove a point. I don see any reason why we can. We had great pit stops last week. We went for it on the strategy and it didn work out but we have to. That is the situation. Second place is a failure when you look at the goal this week. It is win or nothing. We have to race that way. Hopefully it all works out. We will just have to wait and see. We will see what our car has in a few minutes, we will tune on it and give it all we got all week. will see when the race starts and as we get through practice. We know what we have to do. We know that the only option is to win. Have our cars been off a little compared to where they have been in past years? Yes. I would be lying if I said they weren. Richmond is one of those places where we can carry some speed. I was watching the spring race on the way up here. We had a good car. Brad (Keselowski) had a really fast car and we battled up front for the win and finished 1-2. That wasn that long ago. This is a short track which seems to kind of mask some of the challenges we have had with our cars. When I look at those things I feel confident that this is a race track that if we do everything right, it won be easy by any means, but if we do everything right we can squeak one out. just need to go faster. It is just speed in general. The team is still the same team that almost won the championship last year. Nothing has changed there. We just have to get faster. I am proud of the team and the way we have handled these situations. Obviously this is one of the toughest spots we have been in as a team. We haven had to fight to get in the playoffs in a long time. This is a challenging position but the spirits of the team are strong. They are ready to fight and do whatever we have to do to get into victory lane. I am proud of that. This is a time that shows your true character. When I say that, you can be either down on yourself and be beat before you show up to the race track or show up here ready to go and have the right attitude and confidence that we are going to win. That is where the team feels like they are at. I am proud I am with a team like that. I wouldn want to fight this race any other way. mean instead of encumbering the win? I believe the fans came to the race to watch the race and they should see a winner after the race. If you come here to watch tomorrow night and it is a great race, you should know that it was a great race. What happens Wednesday is a challenging situation. How else are we supposed to do it? Do you want to end the race and then wait three hours and let them tear down the car completely and then we go to victory lane and celebrate? That isn e. Everyone would be gone. There would be no stories. You can do it that way. But we also need to have a fair race. We need to make sure we tear these cars apart and find what is right or wrong about the cars. I will say that the penalties handed out with these encumbered finishes have been really small. To me they don really affect the race itself. It is not like it has been a huge deal. There is pushing the line and seeing a little bit of a gap we are all talking about right now and then there is doing things a different way where it is just blatantly obvious, that I believe is really pushing too far. It is what it is. It is the rules we have been given and we all need to play within them. I am alright with that. But we all need to push it to be able to be successful on the race track. We can lay up because you would never be competitive enough to win a race. I do feel like the penalty of the encumbered finish and taking playoff eligibility and points away is very severe. It is very severe. I don think it needs to be more sever. I know. Believe me. You are still watching a great race. Last week was a great race. Hands down. If I am a fan, I am happy that I saw a great race. To me as a competitor, it isn so blatant that I say, , it is awful that they did that. The gap is so small that it isn doing anything. , I don like the word . It isn the classiest thing to say in general. We are talking about something very, very small. You go out there and soak your tires or something like that, then you should be thrown out of the sport. That is a completely different thing. This is pushing the edge. After 500 miles at Darlington or 400 laps here, parts are going to be worked obviously. We are pushing everything to the ragged edge. You are trying to bolt down 800-ish horsepower every lap with a design that is off an old pickup truck. We are talking about U-bolts and truck arms. Things are going to get worked and moved around. Gaps are going to form a little bit. We are pushing the limits on all that stuff. That is obvious to every team out here on the race track. It doesn start with that gap though. It just starts to work into it as the race goes and we don know e where that is going to be sometimes, especially after a long race. . I have thought about this some. The first round in the playoffs may be - I don want to say easier but maybe a little easier than getting in at this point. This is a challenging thing to try to get into the playoffs. There are a lot of fast cars trying to get in. You don typically see this many good cars that have this type of speed being knocked out at this point. Getting in is maybe the most challenging part. After that it is the playoffs we typically see. If you can tie together three strong races anyone can get there. The opportunity is the same for everybody once you get into it. feel like we can get there. Do I think we are there right now? Obviously not. We aren even in the playoffs. I wouldn say we are at that spot. I have seen this sport go through big swings within the period of four or five races where all of a sudden other cars get super fast and the fast cars kind of fall off. It is all about the timing. I never think that we are not. Not for very long at least. Anything can happen. now Richmond ranks number one. If the playoffs ended in a different spot then that track would be number one. We need it really bad. We need to win. I honestly don care the shape or where the track is, we need to win at it. The irony of being here is something. I guess the story would be incredible. If we win, your guys fingers will be burning up on those keyboards. Hopefully I can make you work hard. mindset hasn changed in the last three or four races. When we realized we are going to have to win. The mindset doesn change since then. This is just the last chance. This is the last part. We are trying to use everything we got right here. This is a big weekend for us and a high pressure moment but I love these moments. These are what you live for. If you are going to be successful there is no better feeling. I am e about the challenge ahead and hopefully we make it work out. last few years we have come into this race saying that it was kind of the last vacation race you get in a way. The last weekend that doesn have any stress or pressure before you have 10 weeks of hell. That is what we used to look at it as. Now that pressure has been on us for a long period of time. Over the last few months really. I am trying to get through this little slump we are in. Are we bitter about what happened? It happened. We are in the past. That is in the past. We have to keep looking out the windshield. Roger (Penske) preaches that to us all the time. What has happened, has happened and we can change it. We have to keep looking forward.""",ford,16,43,328.384,0.3,-0.5,n,y,n,n,n,-0.0126093668,0.0015978607,-0.0438124972,-0.0655332471,-0.0645014933,9788,1140,11.6469145893,91.82,y,n,y,y,n,2,5,3,1,4

Not essential, maybe it is possible to do business without it, but it certainly is better to it. Luckily, there are hacks that will make the social media engagement process a seamless part of your overall marketing initiatives. Let face it, everyone wants to offer the ne viral video. But it can be hard to predict what will go viral, a look at this list from . However, there are some safe bets a video celebrating the anniversary of an iconic ad, for instance, will do it. If you are connected at all with the channel on social media you probably saw in your feed this video of celebrating 40 years saw it all over Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook. Are you a Xerox Channel Partner? Maybe you don have a big ad budget, but fortunately, your partner does, and what better way to promote your brand? If you clicked on the link to that Brother Dominic video, you may have noticed a couple of other great e of social media best practices. If you didn, go ahead and click now. I wait. OK, done tearing up at the fond memories of Brother Dominic? Me too. Onto the technical details. This particular e contains a YouTube video embedded in a web page. See that little curved arrow up at the top right? That a button hover over it and you see the word . Click it and you see a number of social media channels on which it can be shared easily and automatically. Easy and automatic is key to this hack. YouTube makes it simple, so whether the YouTube video is embedded in your website or being clicked on from your YouTube channel, viewers can easily share it across a host of social media platforms. Make sure both your document title and description contain the information you want shared (at the very least, your company name). Some social media platforms, like Twitter and Pinterest, will pick up the title, whereas others like LinkedIn and Facebook will grab the entire description. Now, going back to that Brother Dominic blog, if you scroll a little further down the page you see another neat way to encourage sharing a to Tweet callout box: Leverage marketing initiatives with social media strategies that e your message's reach. Tweeting, posting LinkedIn or Facebook updates and sharing on Instagram is only a great brand strategy if you do it more than once in a while. In a vast ocean of content, one little wave will quickly go unnoticed. Stick to a schedule and use tools to help make sure you posting frequently and regularly. allows you to preschedule messages on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Google+ and YouTube. Choose a specific time and date for each message, and bulk upload for a it and forget it e. For Twitter-only simplification, allows for random posting of up to 10,000 Tweets (depending on the plan). Load up those evergreen, non-time-sensitive posts into the and let it roll you can Tweet more than 100 times per day. Just be sure to check in on your jukebox every once in a while to ensure the content is still relevant and don let it take the place of timely, relevant posts. TweetJukebox also automates engaging with your followers to an e. Again, this is not something that should be completely left to the , but it another than nothing solution. Every Friday, the You Tweet tool will thank the top followers who mentioned you during the week. Perhaps less of a hack and more of a good practice, nevertheless there is something to be said for the concept of and conquer. Particularly for smaller businesses without a designated social media manager, enabling more than one team member to post to social media is a great way to ensure it actually gets done. Before you hand over the keys to the car to everyone, however, make sure they know the rules of the road set some basic standards for the various social media platforms on which you interact. But imagine a field service technician posting a picture or video of a particularly gnarly paper jam on Instagram, or a sales rep posting a picture of the world most inefficient workflow on Twitter. The opportunities are endless. Although the platforms continue to evolve, social media appears to be here to stay at least for the foreseeable future. You can avoid it or you can embrace it and (#SpoilerAlert) there is more success to be found in the latter. However, it doesn have to be painful, and with a few good hacks, the process can be made much simpler.

But your first do-it-yourself maintenance can be intimidating. While there are only a few steps perform an engine oil and filter change, it vital that are done right. So, today I am going to give you the six important things (plus a bonus tip) you need to know when changing your own oil. Auto maintenance and repair specialist his tips for changing your own oil. Watch more videos . Follow him his , and . Hey everybody, it Charles from HumbleMechanic.com and today I going to talk the things you got to know before tackling your very first oil. Changing your own oil in your car is an easy way to get into doing your car maintenance. But if you not a DIYer, it also really important to the process and what it takes to change the oil. Doing maintenance on car for the first time can be a little bit scary. Changing oil is actually easy and it only a few steps, but it vital that these steps are done. Not doing them correctly can result in something simple like an oil or even catastrophic engine failure. This is also going to be a great opportunity to check your coolant level, your washer fluid, check your power-steering fluid, as well as your fluid. So here are the things that you got to know before you start. Number one is buying the right stuff. Going into the part store can be with all of the choices. There tons of different oils and filters for you to pick from. When it comes to buying the right oil you need to make sure you getting your vehicle requires. Best resource for that can be the owner book for your. Flip to the page that talks about oil and use the recommended oil. It that if your vehicle engine was designed for synthetic oil that you that. If it doesn say it needs synthetic, you can go ahead and get-based oil. The big takeaways: make sure you buying the right weight oil so if it requires 5w30 you buying that and whether or not it requires. We also want to make sure we getting the correct filter for our. The engines are designed with the OEM filter in mind, but there also a lot of aftermarket filters as well. Generally, when I buying an aftermarket filter, I always get the best one of the. Even from the same manufacturer, filters can be very different. Some vehicles even have a filter that requires a seal replacement, so you want make sure that, if it does require a seal replacement, that you get a filter comes with the new seal. And don forget to get a new crush washer for drain plug. Number two is having the right tools. Just like doing any job, having the tools is really important. You don want to be halfway through a job realize you don have the right stuff and have to make a run to the store. A few of tools that you generally need in order to do an oil change are going to: something to remove the drain plug either a wrench or a ratchet; a tool used remove the oil filter; a drain pan to drain the oil into; some towels for; a funnel to make filling the engine a little bit easier; and, no job this would be complete without plenty of safety equipment. It also to mention that many modern vehicles also have a splash shield, or kind of shield on the bottom of the car that may need to be removed, so going to want to take that into account as well. Number three: Drain the right fluid. This is one that I have seen done wrong lot, both by amateurs/DIYers and professionals. It can be a little bit if you never been underneath the vehicle to figure out one the engine is and which one the transmission is. The best advice is the hood, look down, find the fill cap. If it on the passenger side, the plug should be on the passenger side of the vehicle. If it o the driver side, that your engine, so it should be on the driver side. If you not 100 percent, consult the manual for your vehicle and be sure you drain the right fluid. What happens when you drain the wrong fluid, is you are draining all the fluid of the transmission and double filling the engine oil. Typically, the on the engine and the drain plug on the transmission look very different. Every once in a while, you come across one that looks very similar, so just be that you draining the engine oil, not the transmission fluid. And when it to draining fluids, make sure that the drain pan that we talked about a minute is big enough to hold all the oil. Number four: Proper tightening. We need to great care to make sure that we tightening our drain plug, tightening our filter properly. Tightening it too much over-tightening it can cause damage the drain plug or damage to the oil pan. We can also damage the oil filter or filter housing if we tighten the oil filter too tight. This can also make it really hard to get the oil filter off the ne time we the oil. We also want to make sure that we not leaving it too loose. Leaving it too lose can result in something as simple as an oil leak or result in catastrophic engine failure. So I have a tip; this is the tip give to anyone talking about doing oil changes even professional: Never, ever, ever walk away from a loose drain plug. It either all the way and torqued, or completely out of the vehicle. If you half-turn it in then walk away that generally the point where you get distracted and the comes over to chit-chat with you or the dog gets out, and then you. Now you have a best-case scenario, an oil leak; worst-case scenario, you an engine. So, I recommend using a torque wrench to be sure you get tightened properly. Number Five: sure to set the oil level correctly. Once you done and replace the oil and drain plug, it time to fill it with oil. Pouring oil slow or using a is a great way to help prevent oil spills. Once you have the appro of oil in it, ahead and start the car up and let it run for a few minutes. Then, shut it off, it sit for about a minute. That going to allow the oil to drain back in oil pan. After sitting for about a minute, the dipstick out, clean it off, reinstall it, and pull it back out and the oil level. Most vehicles have a min/max setting for the dipstick. You to make sure that the oil level is in that range. You don want it to be too full and you don want it to be under filled. And if not sure, go ahead and check it a second time. And the big, most important here is, be sure you checking this on level ground. If the vehicle is any kind of angle, it can distort the oil level reading on the dipstick and you to add more oil than you should, or not put enough oil in the. Number Six: Cleanup and disposal. Once we all done with our oil change, it time to take that old oil, that old filter, and dispose of it. Now, you don want to just dump it in the drain. You don want to pour it out in the backyard or throw the oil filter in the. We need to make sure these items are properly recycled. One of the things I to do is buy the big jug of oil and put my old oil back in it when I done. Then, I can just take this to either an auto parts store or a service station ask them if they recycle it for me. It also a good idea to put the in a plastic bag or something so you don wind up with all over your trunk. But when you go there ask them and make sure that is that they do for you. Almost all places would much rather recycle this for you than simply have dump it down the drain. And be sure you don store oily rags. Having piles oily rags can actually be a fire hazard, so make sure you have that stuff as well. And I have a bonus for you guys: Be sure you working very. Always make sure you lifting the vehicle properly. Having an on jack or on vehicle ramps is a great way to keep yourself safe. Also, make sure you wearing safety glasses or gloves. Hot oil in your eye is very, very bad time. So, it time to celebrate; fives all around, guys. Great job and hey, one more thing: Don forget to the mileage and date you did the oil change so you know when the ne due. Alright, I going to wrap it up there. If you guys have any oil change-related, post it down in the comments section. If you want to see more of my, head over a HumbleMechanic.com. You can also follow me on Facebook, Instagram and of course, on YouTube. All right guys, hey, thanks for watching and I see you ne time. We were unable to find agents for your zip code.

SMBs can differ vertically in the markets they serve, like healthcare, education or legal. Yet they also share some common needs. Each have horizontal functions like billing department or a front desk. Regardless of vertical or horizontal functions, each could operate more efficiently and productively, benefiting from automated workflows and feature-rich document-management systems. By deploying MFPs from Xerox, partners open up a world of efficiency for SMB customers, helping them use enhanced scanning and printing solutions to complete horizontal or vertical tasks. Ultimately, partners should aim to enable SMBs to leverage MFP technology from end to end within their business operations. Enhanced scanning and printing solutions can help small and midsize companies achieve efficiency across the gamut, from onboarding new employees to collaborating remotely, and everything in between. Small and mid-size businesses can boost their productivity levels with MFPs and customized apps. When hiring a new staffer, there a lot of paperwork to complete and file. With specialized MFP applications, human resources personnel can scan in a new hire records and trigger an e-mail to a colleague requesting that the paperwork be processed. Remote collaboration is another area that critical for SMBs, especially as they leverage the office and BYOD trends. By developing customized apps, partners can help companies with geographically distributed teams use their MFPs to scan in, route, and share project documentation securely and efficiently. What more, enhanced scanning and printing solutions can streamline processes and dramatically increase productivity for SMBs operating in vertical segments. Realtors can archive client letters and file property disclosure statements electronically. Attorneys at law firms can scan in interrogatories (requests for further information from opposing counsel), have them converted automatically into Word, and route them to the appropriate client folders. Transportation companies can automate and digitize the process of submitting proof-of-delivery notes, and make those notes available through a cloud-based repository. Xerox channel partners can address the general and specific needs and goals of SMBs by leveraging a host of available technologies, services, and tools: For partners serving SMBs, deploying document-management and workflow solutions can cut costs and ma efficiencies across the board. Partners can deploy customized apps to streamline operations in every department, from administration and HR to legal and IT. Partners can use document management as an entry point to assessing a client , working with SMBs to develop comprehensive cloud and mobile solutions. In addition, partners can help SMBs realize the many benefits cost containment and enhanced productivity, among them of a managed print contract. With enhanced scanning and printing solutions, Xerox channel partners can help SMBs achieve their business and financial objectives by focusing on efficiency, productivity, and reduced operational costs.

Please find it available for download ;.;As the release number implies, RhoMobile Suite 4.0 is a huge step forward for the product. Beyond just aligning release numbers between RhoElements and RhoConnect, it offers a rationalized API that will be easy to take forward into the future (we not plan on any significant changes to the e API for quite some time).;Specifically the biggest feature in RhoElements 4.0 is support for JavaScript as a peer to Ruby. You can now perform device capability calls in JavaScript. See our ;for details.;We also now have a Common API for consumer devices (from iOS to Android to Windows Phone) AND industrial devices (Motorola ruggedized devices running Windows Mobile and Android). Previously RhoElements had a single API for consumer devices. But similar functionality for Motorola devices could often require a different API call. Highlights of the Common API simplification include Barcode (combining Barcode and Scanner), Application (combining RhoApplication and Application), and Network (combining AsyncHttp, FileTransfer and Network). Details are available in the Release Notes. Note that RhoElements 2.2 APIs are still available but they are deprecated. On Windows Mobile only the deprecated APIs are supported.;We also have support for iOS7 and Android JellyBean (including forthcoming MSI Android JellyBean devices). We also have support for Windows Phone 8. This includes providing a new way to write RhoMobile apps: our ;. Also note that on Android we now using the stock browser for rendering (instead of Motorola WebKit).;RhoConnect, our app integration and sync server, includes several new features including using JavaScript to write source adapters, a new Model-Controller capability for Ruby source adapters (separating routes from implementations), and support for multiple Redis instances (providing horizontal scalability across multiple Redis servers).;We plan to release the final version of RhoMobile Suite in late September. In the meantime, we encourage you to try the feature complete beta and file specific issues on ;. More general discussion should be on the RMS 4.0 Beta Launchpad section.;We will be holding a webinar on the RMS 4.0 Feature Complete Beta ne Wednesday at 8:00am PST. Register for it ;. Please attend and participate if you have further questions about RhoMobile Suite 4.0. We look forward to talking to you more about RhoMobile Suite soon.;Today we are e to announce the release candidate of RhoMobile Suite 2.2 and RhoElements 2.2 (it should be announced as final early ne week). RhoElements 2.2 continues to e the JavaScript support that we offer. It also e the e array of device capabilities that we offer access to. It offers formal support for our own push service: RhoConnect Push. The RhoMobile Suite 2.2 release also provides the RhoConnect 3.4 release with several other improvements. All of this comes only three months after the RhoElements 2.1 release, demonstrating that the RhoMobile Suite is maintaining its track record of industry leading innovation, only accelerated by its acquisition by Motorola Solutions.;On the JavaScript front we have added many new device capabilities in JavaScript. RhoElements had many capabilities available in JavaScript for Motorola devices with the Motorola WebKit browser that is included with the product. This of course did not allow developers to use JavaScript on consumer devices such as iOS and Android. We now have support for all of the historical Rhodes and RhoElements Ruby APIs in JavaScript. Specifically you can call web services with AsyncHttp, take pictures with Camera, store information to the Database, determine your position with GeoLocation, and get information about the device and environment with System. ;See the ; for more details. ;This is what we have found more than sufficient for most consumer apps. So now customers have the capability of writing entire apps with JavaScript only and not learn Ruby if they so choose. This gives us the focus on JavaScript that some JavaScript only frameworks offer but with the additional major benfits that RhoElements offers over those frameworks: synchronization, scaffolding and app generation, an Object and an IDE. ;In the ne release we will offer the robust set of JavaScript APIs available for Motorola devices on all consumer devices. We will also be adding support for JavaScript controllers (MVC with JavaScript) and JavaScript use of the Rhom Object Relational Mapper. ;We are also adding several e new device capabilities: audio capture and playback, video capture and playback, accelerometer and magnetometer. As devices become more powerful and bandwidth increases, mobile devices to document events in the outside world through video and audio are e. We now offer AudioCapture APIs via JavaScript and Ruby on all popular smartphone operating systems (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Windows Mobile and even Windows desktop apps) and Motorola devices. We also have video capture for Motorola devices and will add for consumer devices in the near future. ;Mobile devices are becoming as sentient as human beings. Motorola Solutions and other mobile device makers are investing in a powerful array of sensor on devices. Today that is location, position and direction (geolocation, magnetometer and accelerometer). In the near future Motorola plans to offer pressure sensors (for touch screens), light sensors and temperature sensors. RhoElements will of course track all of these capabilities and provide a powerful programming model for all of them. Today that means we have added accelerometer for detecting device orientation and movement and magnetometer for determining the direction the device and user are facing. We provided those capabilities across all operating systems as the RawSensor API. ;The RhoConnect Push service, introduced as a beta in RhoElements 2.1, now is formally supported. We have also improved the configuration process for it. RhoConnect Push allows you to send push alerts to users, just as iOS push and Android push (Google Cloud Messaging) services let you. RhoConnect Push lets you do this without using a service in the cloud or requiring a gmail account. Most enterprise customers cannot live with either the iOS push or Google Cloud Messaging and we now offer a compelling option for them. Plus of course we offer it to provide push notification to Windows Mobile devices, who currently have no cloud based or device provided service for push notification. All of this is provided at no additional charge as part of the RhoConnect server offering. ;Using the common RhoElements APIs for push customers can mix and match, using RhoConnect Push to reach Windows Mobile and Android devices, and iOS Push on iOS devices, all from one RhoElements app source code, running on all three operating systems. RhoConnect Push also enables push synchronization, which allows enterprise app data and other data from backend system to be delivered near real-time to users devices. ;RhoConnect push synchronization capabilities insure its lead as the most powerful mobile synchronization server on the market. RhoMobile Suite 2.2 includes the RhoConnect 3.4 release (in the future RhoMobile Suite 4.0 to be released ne year will line up all the version numbers). RhoConnect 3.4 includes major performance improvements. We provide reports and analytics that demonstrate this performance. And we offer recommendations for how to size your own RhoConnect server deployments for your app with our sizing calculator. ;We are very e about RhoMobile Suite 2.2. But we have even more e features in store. We will be providing JavaScript for all capabilities of the framework including MVC, ORM, sync and everything offered by Ruby APIs today. We will continue to track the e array of device capabilities with new sensor APIs for things like pressure, ambient light and temperature as they show up on devices. We will continue to lead in security capabilities by providing FIP 140-2 compliant encryption (no other mobile platform or framework does so). In close partnership with Microsoft we will offer the most advanced framework for Windows Phone 8 development. We will continue to e the offering to new mobile and desktop operating systems. ;Please give RhoMobile Suite 2.2 a try by downloading ;. This is a great e to spend time on ;. We want to know how the framework works for you today and what features you would like to see. But you will also get direct support from other RhoElements developers and even directly from the product developers. ; ; 2017 ZIH Corp and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.

A recent survey of 600 American and European IT decision-makers done by my partner Xerox shows that the time to go fully digital is now, but most organizations still aren ready. Survey respondents predicted an average of only nine percent of key business and office processes will run on paper in the ne two years, but more than half admitted that their organizations processes are still largely paper-based today, and about a third are still communicating via paper rather than via email or social channels. A centerpiece of digital transformation, automation, is a bit further along. Three-quarters of respondents said they already have identified areas for automation. Unfortunately, Xerox report also identified some basics that organizations will have to address before automation and digital workflows can become a reality in key business functions. For instance, 40 percent of respondents have not yet implemented solutions for the mobile workforce and 45 percent have not yet incorporated or improved predictive analysis through the effective use of big data. If any type of organization could benefit from digital transformation, it the university. the tens of thousands of applications that institutions receive each year, to the vast number of student records they must maintain for past and present students, universities are responsible for a massive amount of documents, said Michael Kortan, vice president of workflow automation for Xerox in a recent blog post. manual, paper-based processes that dominate universities stand in stark contrast to the increasingly fast-paced, digital world in which students live. But, in a move that would surprise many who are accustomed to colleges being behind the digital eight ball, some institutions are leading the charge to transform repetitive, error-prone, and tedious tasks into automated and far more accurate digitized processes that save time, productivity, and trees! Solutions vary, but among them are Xerox Workflow Automation Solution for Admissions Processing, which automates paper processes to eliminate delays allowing admissions offices to process applications and get acceptance letters back to selected applicants quickly; Xerox Workflow Automation Solution for Financial Aid, which automates the compilation and delivery of financial aid packages; and Xerox Workflow Automation Solution for Registrar Processing, which eases the administrative burden on registrar staffers as they help students quickly change courses, switch majors, and seek academic guidance. What else is being automated? The better question is, what isn? Student counseling, billing, transcripting, and athletic participation are presently being targeted for greater efficiency and quality of service. The California State University at Fullerton, for e, has ramped up its technology use over the last several years, moving services into the cloud so that they available to everyone in a central location and automating many processes ahead of other schools. Cal State deployed iPad tablets to faculty, management, and some staff and uses a Xerox solution that facilitates direct and secure print-on-demand from mobile devices to machines across campus. This combined with automated scanning and digital distribution of documents has reduced the school paper costs by an estimated $250,000. In addition to saving money, Cal State can now brag about greater environmental sustainability, technological innovation, and process transparency. Removing paper from the equation was probably daunting for Cal State at first. But after efforts to embrace its students digital e that definitely paid off, the university could apparently show American companies a thing or two!

I really want to hear from supplies channel partners about what is, and what isn, working for them. Don hold back. Use the comments section below to share your immediate thoughts. The type of aristocrats portrayed in Downton Abbey eventually died out and disappeared. if they had listened more and looked for solutions that benefited both parties they may have had a better fate.

This blog is quite relative and should become our mantra at Xerox as a whole and in every organization. True leaders listen to understand while managers simply hear to react/respond. The sooner we recognize this, the sooner we will produce both revenue and personal growth. The e future of CPO is right around the corner as we close out a record breaking 2014 and head into a positive 2015. People and relationships are still the most important assets a company must foster to have long term success and are built on trust, mutual respect and recognition of each other roles and responsibilities. Hey Jill, Great to hear from you and also pleased that you agree ! think as you say these are changing times and only by listening and listening hard will we really understand how we can help our partners grow in they way they want.

[The future is] about sustainable development, not just throwing away the analogue bathwater for the sake of it. Photo courtesy of Anders Sorman-Nilsson. After a stint at a marketing consultancy, he branched off on his own, founding the think tank, , in 2005 and consulting big-name companies on how to adapt to change in an increasingly world. (Clients have included Apple, Cisco and Xerox.) The issue hits close to home. In 1917, Anders great-grandfather started a clothier business in Stockholm. He prided himself in knowing the first names and family history of his clients and believed in personal, face-to-face connections. Nearly a century later, the family business still e, but Anders parents are struggling to connect with clients in a changing world, battling online retailers who offer convenience and cheaper prices, even if the items are lower quality. Anders believes the key to his family business survival is merging the old and the new: Finding a way to hold on to the traditions that made his great-grandfather successful while adapting to the technology that modern customers e. These days, the Australian-Swedish futurist, innovation strategist and author divides his time between consulting and speaking engagements, focusing on the concept of the convergence of digital and analogue. Anders recently talked about how he helps companies achieve the right balance between the two. Digital disruption is a combination of what happening in e communication and technology as much as anything. It comes down to a communications challenge. When you driving digitization initiatives, you might see several of the owner partners not really adopting the technology. What kind of message does that send to the rest of that organization? You want to make the complex simple through technology but sometimes, there a very heavy resistance. A typical e of this is a client of mine who had a fantastic YouTube campaign. An advertising company came in and really worked with their employment banks, spoke about their workplace culture of nice things that win the hearts and minds no one was able to view it because YouTube was blocked on their server. I still have companies send me documents in 2003 Microsoft PowerPoint. Eleven years later, they haven upgraded the way they should have. Large organizations can get very much stuck in being slow to move, and trying to protect market share and not being able to adopt the latest technology. On the other hand, startups sometimes move too fast and often find themselves on the edge instead of the edge. Sometimes they too early and might not go mainstream. Let me see if I can answer this way. Despite all of this rush to digitize and find the latest for as cheap as possible, vinyl record sales are up 20 percent. Why is that when we have Spotify or digital downloads? You don remember those like you remember your first vinyl record or your first cassette. Digital can sort of seem ephemeral, but it doesn necessarily touch the heart. Timelessness means timeliness, old meets new, modern meets traditional it quite important to combine the timeless wisdom of older staff with that digital combination. When you get that mix right, magic can happen. My parents are finally understanding that digital is not a threat. Even if the business doesn survive and thrive, at least there will be a nice digital playbook of everything we stand for. It time to stop just singing in the shower hoping people will come into the shop it about retaining the digital communications. As you look to the future, remember the past as well. It about sustainable development, not just throwing away the analogue bathwater for the sake of it. For startups, it looks a little different. They might be able to brand and digitally engage. You have a great website, but are you able to win friends and influence? Some of these trends seem sort of mutually e, but there a great mantra by F. Scott Fitzgerald: test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function. Maybe says analogue and digital are not mutually e, but can co-e. We have to look at how the digital makes the complex simple in some ways. An e: The New York consumer has really sought the e of farm to table. We can read on the menu that the fish we about to consume has been line caught within 50 kilometers. But can it be verified? With digital traceability, nowadays it not just farm to table or farm to fork, but farm to iPhone. You can scan the rib-eye steak in a supermarket, through the QR code and see its whole lifecycle. That brings this whole craving of farm to fork into the digital realm, where digital storytelling can really emerge. Hi! Quick question that entirely off topic.

As more and more companies realize that product differentiation is transient, they turning to customer e as the source of advantage. But as a holistic discipline, customer e (CX) is still fairly new. Another, similar discipline has been around a bit longer: user e. UX, as Wikipedia puts it, the practical, e, affective, meaningful and valuable aspects of human interaction and product ownership. Since the dawn of the Web, the UX people have developed ideas, tools, and techniques that help them design better websites, software, and mobile apps. 11 ideas that will improve your customer e, courtesy of user e principals. http:/ctt.ec/J3y1l+ http:/ctt.ec/5CndU+ So here the question: what can CX people learn from the UX pros? are some thoughts: The best UX people start with users and their needs before a pencil ever touches paper. do we want them to do? is a question sales or marketing people often ask. do they want to do? is the starting point of UX pros. To answer that question, they go to the source: users. Through interviewing, they develop written personas lists of defining characteristics to help them focus on different categories of users and what they want. There are always multiple personas, because there is never just one universal user. Of equal importance, the UX pros do not ask the company to characterize the needs of their customers. The inherent bias of that feedback will always be tainted. Maybe we all design better customer interactions if we really started with our users, not with our own agenda. A big part of this is recognizing that we have multiple groups of users, each with different needs. It not a one-size-fits-all proposition, yet companies routinely throw all their users into a single box. Good UX doesn break structural convention. You don find many horizontal scrolling ecommerce sites, for instance. Good UX also uses good information design, so users find things where they e to find them. It all adds up to a feeling of familiarity with the structure. That familiarity lets the value of the content shine through. Restaurants that -invent the ordering e often annoy more guests than they please. If everyone already understands something it ain broke. Don make them learn Latin if all they want is a cup of coffee. One of the best UX books we read is called . His central premise is simple: Don make users guess where a feature is hiding or figure out how to do a simple task. Make it super-obvious. How many baffling interactions with companies have we all had? Returning a rental car used to be a process Rubik Cube. Now, for the better rental companies, it as simple as driving up and giving the keys to the agent. The best websites use what they know about the customer to deliver a more relevant e, instead of a generic one. Returning users feel good about being recognized. Could your customer e beyond the Web be just as personalized? If that rental car company knows you like convertibles, wouldn it be great if they had one waiting for you? Or, failing that, perhaps a note: John, Sorry we out of convertibles. We hope this vehicle will be comfortable for you. Have a great visit here in Seattle. Each of us has our own e, our own individual responses to a given condition. As highly designed as Disney World is, different people have different strategies for navigating through it, different goals, and different outcomes. So a good UX designer doesn try to limit or codify user e. Instead, they design an environment where e can be found. Using wireframes, they design multiple paths through a website and consider multiple conte. Companies can build plans, like wireframes, for designing better and more fluid customer interactions. Where is it written that all interactions must be centralized and controlled through service reps? Or that you only see clients once a year at a user conference? There are many ways to journey through Disney World, but nearly everyone leaves with a smile. , former principal designer at Twitter, notes that UX should be a conversation. UX professionals seek a dialog with users to find out how to best help them. So UX becomes more like a service, not a one-off, reactive project. The conversation metaphor defines how to deliver, how to improve, and how to stay relevant. Conversations move from topic to topic and it not always about work. Sure, send users a survey and acknowledge their participation. But also do things like sponsor events where you can listen to customers as well as speak to them. Or build in feedback loops through the customer journey. Learning anything entails some elements of challenge or stress. The needs of a new user can differ greatly from a familiar user, and differ yet again from a power user. A person can pass from one UX persona to the ne in the course of a progressive e. A company that recognizes and adjusts to that growth could win real loyalty. Can your customer e be more progressive? One e: Loyalty programs let companies treat frequent customers differently than new ones. They also collect valuable data about each customer patterns and preferences so they can make every engagement more relevant and useful. notes that ease of use isn the only measure of a positive user e; enjoyment is just as important. Something can be clear and simple, but if it boring or cold it can feel tough to get through. Designs should have flourishes of warmth, kindness, whimsy, richness anything that makes the person feel engaged and energized. Look for occasions and ways to smile or say you in une places in the customer journey. A cold glass of lemonade for customers lining up at a ticket counter. Offering the choice of ukulele or tuba on hold. Build thoughtfulness and a wink into routine transactions (where it makes sense of course). offers some tips for converting one-time visitors into repeat visitors: Constantly provide new, high-quality content on your top landing pages. Show users similar content elsewhere on your site. Make it easy for users to connect with you via social networks. Let users subscribe to your email list for updates. Make it easy to interact through forums, ratings and recommendations. What are the analogs for this kind of engagement-building in the non-digital world? Maybe it constantly freshening up shop windows. Or creating you like this, you like these in retail stores. Or building in feedback systems in B2B processes. The UX mindset might make it easier to spot these opportunities. In pursuing more thoughtful UX goals, never disregard the simple ones. A slow website is a failure. Make it fast. Look for ways to speed up your customer interaction with your company as well. Too many commercial interactions put the burden of administration on the customer. Customers will respect you if you respect their time. UX people test everything. They learned that their hunches are an unreliable guide to better interface design. The right testing methodologies (implicit, e, creative) will vary from one case to another, but there is no case where testing is not essential to continued success. How many of your customers e have been derived from testing? Do you have data to support the most important customer-facing processes in your business? UX and CX are different things. But as you design customer e and journeys for your business, it can help to think like a UX pro. No, the world doesn always behave like software, but a disciplined, data-driven, empathetic approach to customer e can only lead to happier customers who return again and again. and receive email updates when we publish a new article. This is a really great article. Many of the points here are things I been from the mountain top for years. It good to see these principles being embraced by others now. I read Steve Krug Make Me Think. Even though it now a fairly old book (I think about 10 or 12 years old) the overarching principles he presents are still as valid as ever. Jakob Nielsen also teaches similarly to this article, and to Steve Krug usability standards. Articles like this one help us to remember that it all about the user. As a UI/UX Architect, I feel it important to be reminded of what we should be thinking about sometimes regarding the User E, and now the Customer E.

Increase your protein levels, eat more foods with higher protein levels. You are most likely insulin resistant and that causes weight gain and will prevent weight loss. Chromium is often missing in diets and that is one very important mineral to improve your insulin resistance. Chromium will also reduce those cravings for sugar and carbs.

Imagine that they are happy, even eager, to take your call. They know all about you. They understand why you should both be talking. They may even have particular needs or projects they wish to discuss with you. In the first article of this series, we discussed how social media fits into the sales cycle. We saw that social media is an e way to engage with your connections and create warm prospects. We also saw that to move people from social media connections into hardened sales prospects, you must move them from an online connection (social media) to an offline connection (real life). In my last article I showed you how to choose the right social media connections to focus these sales efforts on. Today we are going to look at to move them into real life connections. It important to transition these connections correctly. They may take it the wrong way if you suddenly start hitting them with a sales pitch straight away. And then you would have wasted all your efforts in creating a warm prospect through social media. I have occasionally had success using just social media. However, in my e, the huge majority of B2B customers will require a direct approach in order to make a successful sale. With that in mind, here are four strategies that can be used to move a social media connection into real life. If you have a prospect that seems engaged, try starting a dialogue with them. Remember, the dialogue should be about them. Ask them about themselves or their business (just as you would in a face-to-face conversation). You could respond to content that they have shared or comments they have made. Once this becomes a two-way dialogue, it is easy to suggest taking the conversation to e-mail or phone. Once conversation is progressing, you can decide between you and your connection if there is a sales opportunity worth pursuing. I often reach out to engaged prospects in this way. I suggest that we have a conversation to get to know each other better and see if there are ways we can help each other. Oftentimes, there is something that each individual can benefit from. Many people are happy to take me up on this offer. The aim of this conversation is to stay away from sales! I like to have these conversations on Skype so that they are as near face-to-face as possible. I always try to start by making the conversation all about the other person. I also try to offer ways in which I can help them which are not about selling my services. I am always surprised by how many of these conversations do reveal sales opportunities. I never start these conversations with sales in mind or on the agenda. But opportunities often arise. They are usually suggested by the other person, which makes life a lot easier! This is a great way to have a lot of to know you conversations in one day. Whenever I am going to an event, I message all my relevant social media contacts and ask if they are attending and would like to meet with me. Sometimes I have missed the opportunity to see an event because I have been in back-to-back meetings! Creating your own event can be another effective way to get to meet social media connections in real life. Make sure the event focuses on customer interests, rather than yourself. After my last article, I asked you to create a list of the right prospects to engage with. Now I want you to pick a couple of prospects from the list and move the conversation offline, using one of these four strategies. Naturally, just as in any sales process, you won be successful with every prospect. However, your success rate will be much higher than if you use traditional methods to contact cold prospects. In fact, you may well end up having several of the perfect sales calls that I described at the start of this piece.

The new Ford Mustang offers the most compelling package yet. The e of the new Ford Mustang delivers a sleeker, more athletic appearance while retaining the instantly-recognisable character honed through more than 50 years of production. The bonnet profile is now lower with integrated air vents, combined with a revised lower grille design to give the Mustang a sharper, more aggressive face, while improving aerodynamics. The Mustang dramatic rear-end design is further enhanced with a re-modelled bumper and diffuser element, accommodating standard quad-tailpipes for the 5.0-litre V8 model that testify to the power and performance available. In addition, Mustang is now offered with a new optional boot spoiler for an even sportier profile. Crisp, clear and energy-efficient, Mustang headlights, daytime running lights, indicators and iconic three-dimensional tri-bar tail lights now all feature LED technology as standard for Mustang models in Europe, with LED foglights also available. The front headlight bezels also have been restyled to reflect the trapezoidal shape of the upper grille. A wider range of customisation options will enable Mustang customers in Europe to make even more of a statement. Three bold, dynamic new metallic paint colours are available Kona Blue, Orange Fury and Royal Crimson. New 19-inch forged alloy wheels are offered in multiple finishes each with a unique character, including Nickel, Ebony Black and Polished Aluminium. The new Mustang interior delivers a more premium feel. Soft touch materials now feature for the door linings and the door handles are finished in aluminium.

E performance and a fun-to-drive e have been at the heart of the Mustang DNA since the first model was launched in 1964. New powertrain, chassis and technology enhancements enable the new Mustang to deliver the most rewarding driving e yet. Ford 5.0-litre V8 engine has been further developed to deliver more power and a higher rev-limit than ever before. Anticipated peak power of 450 PS is supported by the introduction of Ford new dual-fuel, high-pressure direct injection and low-pressure port fuel injection system, which also increases low-end torque. The new Mustang 2.3-litre EcoBoost delivers 290 PS, and offers a more responsive and engaging driving e thanks to a transient overboost function for the turbocharger triggered under heavy acceleration to provide an e burst of boost following each up-shift and Ford new 10 transmission. The advanced new 10-speed automatic transmission offers greater fuel efficiency, and improved acceleration. The gearbox electronic control system enables settings that optimise performance for Drive Modes, and real-time adaptive shift-scheduling allows the transmission to adapt to changing conditions and select the right gear in any situation from coast-road cruising to the drag-strip. Steering wheel-mounted paddles-shifters allow drivers ma control. , when you shift gears, you give up time, said Matthias Tonn, Mustang chief programme engineer, Ford of Europe. Mustang new 10-speed transmission enables the engine to deliver peak power and torque while up-shifting, for faster acceleration and seamless performance. We e the result to be our fastest accelerating Ford Mustang yet. Ford six-speed manual gearbox is enhanced to manage the power of the 5.0-litre V8 engine with a twin-disc clutch and dual-mass flywheel, for greater durability and quicker gear changes. The engine delivers Launch Control as standard for ma traction and consistent standing starts. Electronic Line Lock that applies only the front brakes, allowing the driver to spin the rear wheels and warm the tyres while stationary, is now standard with the 2.3 EcoBoost engine, in addition to the 5.0 V8 helping achieve optimised standing start performance. Ford engineers have further optimised Mustang driving dynamics to deliver the most engaging driving e yet. Recalibrated shock absorbers improve stability through corners, and rear suspension is stiffened with a cross-a joint that reduces unwanted movement at each corner that can lead to body flex. Thicker anti-roll bars also better control body-roll for sharper handling. A new optional MagneRide Damping System can deliver a lightning-quick response to changing road conditions. A unique fluid inside the damper can be electronically stimulated to offer higher or lower damping resistance, depending on the driving scenario. Sensors monitor conditions one thousand times per second to ensure optimum handling performance. Two new Drive Modes are now offered to help drivers match electronic stability control, throttle response, automatic gear-shift patterns, steering and Active Valve Performance E settings to the driving scenario. In addition to Normal, Sport, Track and Snow/Wet Modes: New Active Valve Performance E technology means drivers can for the first time adjust the intensity of the Mustang e note to suit their mood and the driving scenario. The innovative Good Neighbour Mode can be programmed to automatically limit the e noise output at pre-programmed times of the day to avoid disturbing neighbours, not least when firing up the legendary 5.0-litre V8 early in the morning. The new Ford Mustang will be offered to customers in Europe with a comprehensive range of driver assistance technologies including Pre-Collision Assist with Pedestrian Detection designed to reduce the severity of and, in some cases, even mitigate frontal collisions involving vehicles and pedestrians. Mustang for the first time will also be offered with Adaptive Cruise Control and Distance Alert technologies that help drivers maintain an appropriate distance to the vehicle ahead, as well as Lane Departure Warning that can warn when drivers unintentionally drift out of lane, and Lane Keeping Aid that can apply torque to the steering wheel to steer the vehicle back into lane. The sophisticated technologies will contribute to an improved Euro NCAP rating safety rating. A customisable, all-digital, 12-inch LCD instrument cluster will deliver information displays optimised to match the selected Drive Mode similar to the Ford GT supercar helping drivers get the most from every driving e. The cluster configuration will automatically change depending on Drive Mode, and can be programmed by the driver to display a range of gauges in one of seven colours. Drivers of Mustangs equipped with the 12-inch display will see an industry-first, video-game-style animation when the Electric Line Lock feature is activated. The new Mustang also features Ford SYNC 3 communications and entertainment system, which allows drivers to control their connected smartphones, audio, navigation, and climate functions with conversational voice commands, and by using pinch and swipe gestures on the central 8-inch touch screen. The system is compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Deliveries of the new Ford Mustang for customers in Europe will begin in 2018.'",ford,11,38,375.746,0.2,-0.5,n,n,n,n,y,-0.0488501704,-0.0063657213,-0.0008144728,-0.0390818752,0.005670477,9228,461,4.9956653663,37.23,y,n,y,y,n,2,5,3,1,4

They are threatened by two very different types of competition. The first of these is the supermarket. They carry a huge range of goods. These are all-in-one convenient places. The pricing is competitive. Ne, traditional shopkeepers suffer from Internet retailers. Why bother to go to a shop when you can simply place your order online in your pajamas and for the lowest price? Just like the print industry, traditional shopkeepers are suffering from the rise of the commodity market. These shopkeepers are focusing on niche markets. They are building up a group of loyal customers who value their market knowledge. They also value the fact that these shops carry hard-to-find specialist goods. These are often not available elsewhere. Customers are happy to pay a premium price for all these items. These shops have built their success on avoiding trying to be all things to everyone. They know that they will not succeed in the commodity marketplace. They have chosen to make good profits from a smaller group of people. Just like shops, I am seeing the rise of a number of successful printing companies that focus on specific target markets. They also accept that they cannot be all things to everyone. So they concentrate on a specific target market. Printing companies that focus on specific target markets will find it easier to build profitable relationships with their clients. They are more likely to control a pipeline of sales. They find it easier to achieve their sales targets. The trouble is, many sales teams are not given any direction about which prospects to focus on. They are left to go out and chase after whatever type of client they choose. This typically means that they have a very generic sales message. They are competing with the commodity market. And, as a result, the printing company sometimes finds that they have customers that they would really rather not deal with. At this point, I am often asked a very sensible question. The best way to choose a target market is to look closely at your top customers. Which ones would you like more of? These are the ones to base profiling your target market on. If you really want to get some good insight into your customer world I would highly recommend interviewing current clients. This gives you an opportunity to find out their business challenges. It also gives you an opportunity to find out why they choose your company rather than competition. With a little bit of research you should be well placed to start bringing similar customers. Some sales people have a problem with this strategy. Naturally, this depends on the target market. I have certainly seen some printing companies focus on one market and have more than enough work. However, this doesn work for everyone. The answer is to focus on more than one target market. This strategy also allows you to make the most of the strengths of individuals in your sales team. It means that your company will be dependent on the fortunes of one market vertical. Now it time to think about how you can roll out the strategy of target markets to your sales team. The purpose of this meeting should be to outline the target market strategy to your sales team. At this point you can discuss as a group which target markets you would like to focus on. Then it time for the ne action point. This will allow you to create a sales message that works for this market sector. We talk more about this in my ne article. This outlines in writing e the sort of client that your company will focus on. It gives specific guidance to the sales team. It can be especially useful when a new member joins the team.

I feel like this is such an important part of having a target market. Make your company known as the go-to company when it comes to knowledge of your particular niche. Make your company a thought leader in the industry. I look forward to the ne installment! Melissa Thank you for taking the time to comment You always add great insight to the conversation. We appreciate it! Thanks for your comments Melissa. I do feel that the whole idea of target market is under-rated. It is vital to know which prospects to focus on. Most businesses avoid to do research. I recently read an article about Skullcandy success story versus Kodak failure. Successful companies know e who their customers are, what they do, why they will shop, how much they have to spend, etc. When you know that information, then the right sales message comes easy! Thanks for posting these useful tips.

The Company believes the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific income tax characteristics of such entities and is a useful measure of evaluating the relative monetary significance of crude oil and natural gas properties.

It sits on the website unread and unloved. The only activity is the tumbleweed blowing through the posts. In my , I suggested that it as easier to engage with a small social media audience. However, it is also possible to have an audience. A blog is a great way to create engagement from prospects and clients. However, this strategy only works if people read it. Many people who have blogs spend a lot of time writing content. But they don go and spread the word about their content. Without telling people that your blog e, there is little point in writing it. Let look at three strategies to promote your blog. LinkedIn groups are a great way to find a very targeted audience. The first rule for printing companies that want to use LinkedIn groups is to use the right ones. It is important to choose groups where you will find customers your peers. These are rarely the groups that focus on printing. Instead, focus on marketing and business groups. You will find that LinkedIn groups can be highly focused. You will probably find a group that is dedicated to e the market vertical that you wish to engage with. (To find groups, use the search bar at the top of the LinkedIn screen and set the button on the left to groups. See illustration below.) Make sure you are aware of the rules of posting for the groups that you choose. Some groups welcome relevant blogs. Others prefer that blogs be added to the promotions section, which actually gets your blog very little e. I have found that LinkedIn groups have driven a lot of traffic to my blog. But there is another useful social media route as well. Twitter can be a very effective way of driving traffic to your blog. It can drive traffic even if you do not have many followers. If you are engaged with people on who have larger groups of relevant followers, they will often re-tweet good information. These people are called influencers. In this way your post can reach a much larger audience. Make sure that the type of customers you wish to engage are active on Twitter. Twitter works best for consumers and smaller businesses. There one last place to promote your blog. Much of the trade press is eager for good content. If you are writing posts with useful information (rather than just promoting your printing services), many people may be keen to feature it. Make a list of places where you would like your blog content featured. Reach out to the editors of these blogs and publications and ask if they would like to feature your content. You may be surprised at the results. Facebook now chooses what content is seen by users in their timelines. The chances of your content being seen by the right people are small. These days I would suggest that Facebook is rarely worth the effort. However, you want to be able to rely on more than just passing social media traffic to make sure that your content is read. You want readers who receive your content on a regular basis. You also want to make sure that your customers are receiving this content. That why it is important to build a newsletter list. We will look at how to do this in my ne article.

Nov 02, 2016 Dec 01, 2016 Jan 18, 2017 Great article. Since you forgot to mention Google+ This is really very informative. i have tried all these things for my . But i haven get much traffic there. i want some any other technique that will help me to get more traffic. . Thank you for your comments. I did not mention Google+ as I have had very little traction from it when I was active there Matthew, Facebook is probably worth consideration, especially for smaller printers who focus on local markets. Promoted posts are the last PPC bargain available, and Facebook offers demographic sorts that let you select relevant audience segments. The 30+ age group is on Facebook regularly and FB knows a lot about the interests of their members. It true that organic reach is very limited, but small printers can target very effectively for small dollars. It a good way to promote blog posts and it can produce results if there is a strong call to action and offer. Richard Thanks for taking the time to write are spot-on. As the largest social network and with incredibly robust targeting tool-sets, Facebook is absolutely a channel that printers should look to market their business and blogs.

Now that has been replaced by developing a mobile strategy then building a web site. That because mobile is the way that people now access web sites and the Internet. This year mobile access officially became the primary way that consumers access the Internet, according to eMarketer. of all digital media now is viewed on a mobile device, compared with only 42 percent for laptops and desktops. What more, ComScore reports that of all web viewers now use mobile devices e for web browsing. It is estimated that roughly 91 percent of adults have their smartphone within reach 24 hours a day. Clearly, mobile has taken over as the front door to the Internet for most people. If you part of a growing company, your IT resources are likely stretched thin already. It important to spend time on the projects that have the most strategic impact. Prioritize mobile first to go where your customers will find you. Here 5 reasons why: 5 ways mobility will grow your #smallbiz in 2016 via @JTRipton Looking a web site on a mobile device is a drastically different e than browsing from a computer. The need for website design that accommodates mobile users is so great, earlier this year Google created what developers called when it announced that it would lower the search results for any web site that wasn mobile friendly. Mobile-friendly means a clean design, first and foremost, because small mobile screens cannot handle an overly cluttered page. The amount of te on a page also should be reduced, as mobile users need the ability to quickly scan pages and digest small amounts of content at a time. Further, sites designed for mobile lay greater emphasis on visuals, which work well on mobile, and generally favor responsive web design that adjusts layout according to the screen size accessing the site. Apps are a great way to e your reach to customers on mobile, and may make sense if you can offer something truly useful with interactivity you can leverage through a browser. are stickier than web sites, helping a business build a continuous relationship with customers. Developing an app also allows businesses to bring better functionality to users. , for instance, when integrated into your app, enables businesses to implement click-to-call functionality directly into the app for a more seamless customer e. Customers can click a button on the app and be connected directly with a customer service rep who can visually demonstrate product use by way of real-time video, and customers can ask pre-sales questions on chat or video while browsing at a store or considering an online purchase. Roughly of mobile users now use their devices for shopping while in-store, according to ComScore, and three out of every five web searches is performed via mobile device. An estimated 90 percent of these mobile phone searches result in a purchase or store visit. This is largely because mobile devices are always by the side of consumers, so when there a need or a want for a product or service, looking for the right solution online and conducting research makes the most sense from a mobile phone. With half of all travel and restaurant mobile searches leading to a purchase, it is incumbent that businesses realize that the most critical point of contact with consumers outside of an in-store visit is through mobile devices. If you still are not persuaded on the importance of a mobile strategy, stop to consider this fact: of te messaging coupons are opened within fifteen minutes of having been sent, as multiple studies have shown. Since mobile devices are taking on an increasingly important role during the buying process for consumers, these devices also are the right vehicles for marketing and targeted promotions because they hit consumers while they are making purchases. More than half of all smartphone users surveyed recently said they would prefer receiving promotional offers on their smartphones, and 70 percent of all Americans said they would be interested in special promotions delivered to their mobile device. of mobile coupons also are shared with one or more friends, too. Mobile phones are the preeminent vehicles for social media, and they are in the hands of consumers during the shopping process. This makes mobile a critical focus for marketers, and every business needs a plan for how they will market via mobile. The millennial generation has officially overtaken the baby boomers as the largest single group of consumers today. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that there now are 75.3 million millennial consumers, compared with only 74.9 million baby boomers. Focusing on millennials is not just about catering to young consumers known for spending more than other age groups, it is about orienting toward the largest living generation in the U.S. It should come as no surprise, too, that millennials are increasingly centered on their mobile devices as a result of being the first generation to fully grow up with the technology. More than 85 percent of millennials use a smartphone, and 20 percent rely on it e for Internet browsing according to ComScore. Three quarters use mobile for online research prior to purchases. If your business cares about the largest group of consumers today, it needs a solid mobile strategy.

As they move toward digitization, SMBs want to keep printing costs down, simplify document workflows and collaboration processes, and achieve sustainability goals, all while maintaining productivity levels without interruption. The MFP is at the heart of document management in most SMB settings. Solution providers working with Xerox ConnectKey MFPs can create simple, tried-and-true document management solutions for SMB customers in a variety of different business segments. Typical document management solutions and services address challenges such as digitizing hard-copy records, making copy jobs more efficient, streamlining back-office transaction processing, and more. Digitizing paper records doesn have to be a major chore. Solution providers can help SMB customers by integrating technology with MFPs that allows them to scan documents and make them accessible to authorized parties within an organization just by inserting paperwork in the document feeder and pressing a few buttons. Channel partners can also provide customers with a disaster-recovery service tied to this record digitization solution, automatically backing up in the cloud any digital records scanned from hard copies. Partners can help SMBs integrate technology with MFPs. Many SMBs also struggle with other intersections of paper-based and digital workflows for e, with digitizing paper receipts, scanning documents to e-mail, and similar tasks. Xerox channel partners can assist customers in overcoming such workflow hurdles with off-the-shelf software solutions, such as an app that lets users scan receipts from a device into a cloud storage destination like Dropbox for their e reports. Partners can also enroll SMB customers in third-party specialist e programs to further streamline their day-to-day workflow and free up staff to focus more e on core business objectives. Solving SMB document management problems is often a matter of combining technologies and services readily available to Xerox channel partners. These include: : Multi-function printers with the ConnectKey platform enable solution providers to install and configure applications for managing, securing, and storing digital documents. Xerox App Studio (XAS) and (PAB) tools: With ready-to-go, template-based apps, along with PAB tools, partners can create personalized solutions from office and managed print services (MPS) to production. (Partners without software development capabilities can collaborate with PAB developers.) Authentication, Authorization, and Access Control Systems: Hardware and software can be combined to control access to MFPs and scanned records through multifactor authentication. Professional Services: Qualified staffers identify SMB customers needs and design appropriate solutions that integrate with their e IT hardware, software, and network design. Smaller businesses often outsource basic IT services that are handled in-house by larger firms. In addition to providing hardware, software, and network maintenance, Xerox channel partners serving SMBs have opportunities to deliver hosted solutions such as cloud-based backup and recovery services. and can act as trusted advisors in helping to implement automated workflow solutions. Partners can offer a full array of managed print services to SMBs for recurring revenue after equipment is delivered and solutions are implemented. These attachable services include providing mobile printing and file management capabilities, business continuity services, cloud storage, security maintenance, remote access provisioning, and more. SMBs face many of the same challenges with modernizing their document management processes as enterprises. But unlike larger organizations, SMBs often don have the resources or the know-how to deploy document management solutions on their own. Xerox channel partners have the advantage of working with and a growing host of apps and pre-designed solutions that can solve just about any document management problem an SMB customer is facing. / for more easy-to-implement managed print solutions that will wow your customers.

Today that job description applies to a growing number of us. Think of field agents, contractors, freelancers, sales e and many more. that by 2020, mobile workers will make up almost three quarters of the total U.S. workforce, bringing the total to over 105 million. Industries like manufacturing, retail and healthcare tend to be more mobile, but others are catching up. Healthcare has the at 18 percent of its total U.S. mobile worker base. The story is much the same globally, with estimates putting the global mobile workforce at 1.75 billion in 2020 almost 38 percent. The mobile genie isn going back into the bottle, and who would want that anyway? has become synonymous with productivity both inside and outside the workplace, and the mass adoption of mobile technology has cultivated an environment where workers e to leverage mobile technology at work, IDC research analyst, Mobile Enterprise Device Solutions. is good for business, because it puts us closer to customers, workflows and colleagues. Businesses and their vendor partners just have to keep getting better at it. No surprise then that organizations and vendors are rapidly gearing up to support these untethered employees. IDC Bassett rightly notes that the growing needs of the mobile workforce have spawned solutions specifically designed to meet emerging requirements. Mobile workflow solutions are getting the attention they deserve, especially through Where there are mobile workers, there are likely mobile documents, and documents, devices and workflow are what bring MPS to the mobility party. Different mobile workflows must be available to keep people connected to their end-to-end work processes. MPS providers have stepped up with to allow any end-user device to securely print to any imaging device as part of an overall mobile print solution. Mobile employees require responsive support from their organizations, and if that support involves an intelligent multi-function printer, all the better. Any time a task or process can be automated by using an MFP, that time not being taken from a human employee. Mobile strategies then, lead to more productivity both inside and outside of the office. Today, MPS can make life much easier for mobile employees and the IT teams that support them. Capabilities like these give mobile workers the tools they need to do their jobs, wherever they are: The ability to connect and print from multiple devices is critical for today workers. Some Ne-gen MPS providers offer options for secure, accurate printing from most mobile devices to any printer or multifunction printer, regardless of brand. This makes it easy to print typical Microsoft PowerPoint, Word and other standard files from wireless and mobile devices, whether you offsite or onsite. Some MPS providers also give the option of mobile print solutions with an onsite server for your internal network, or behind your network firewall, for added control and higher volume use. Mobile printing through the cloud easily supports local and remote locations and controls visitors printing access. Offerings range from basic free services to more advanced for-fee solutions. For e, a basic version might offer an app resident on the device user panel and enable a simple email to the cloud to pull print jobs to the particular multifunction printer. Some ne-gen MPS providers offer a free mobile app that lets workers scan, email and fax from an Android or iOS-based mobile device to certain multifunction printers. The app also lets them send data to and print from cloud storage. The app provides one-touch workflows between a mobile device and a multifunction printer. Using a manual address or QR code identification for pairing, automatic device discovery makes it easy to find and pair a mobile device with a nearby multifunction printer. Mobile workers can print to certain printers and multifunction printers from a mobile device without connecting to a network. Wherever work takes us, more organizations depend on mobile workers, they need different tools and systems to make sure these employees stay productive wherever they are.

The report evaluates Citrix NetScaler, a key component of the companys virtualization, networking and cloud computing strategy. Gartner defines a vendor in the Leaders Quadrant as one who has the ability to shape the market by introducing additional capabilities in its product offerings, and by raising awareness of the importance of these features. Key capabilities for a leader revolve around the advanced platform ADC capabilities that focus on enterprise application capabilities. We e a leader to have strong or growing market share, especially in the advanced platform ADCs, and to have solutions that resonate with an increasing number of enterprises. E in complex data center application deployment also is a necessity to be a leader in the Magic Quadrant for Application Delivery Controllers. ; delivery infrastructure transforms todays traditional enterprise datacenter built upon rigid, isolated network devices into tomorrows cloud-based virtual datacenter that is fle and scalable enough to deliver IT as an on-demand service. As a foundational component of Citrix OpenCloud solutions, NetScaler provides enterprise customers and cloud providers alike with powerful virtualization and networking capabilities. In addition, NetScaler accelerates and secures web applications for thousands of corporate customers, and is the delivery infrastructure of choice for most of the worlds largest cloud providers and websites, touching an estimated 75 percent of all Internet users each day.; center consolidation and the move toward cloud adoption are the two primary drivers for IT transformation today.

b'https://www.blackstone.com/media/blogs/article/byron-wien-s-surprise-for-2045-a-more-peaceful-world',12,39,228.965,11,291.51,14,20,21,1129,76,14,"b' ; January for the past 30 years, Byron Wien has published his Ten Surprises for the coming year ten events that the average investor would only assign a one out of three chance of taking place, but which Byron believes is probable, having a better than 50% likelihood of happening.; process starts in August, when he hosts a series of four lunches bringing together leading figures in finance to discuss issues of the day, including George Soros, Carl Icahn, Wilbur Ross, and even Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman. It is not a social lunch, he says. Once he feels he understands the consensus view of the financial and geopolitical issues of the day, Byron considers how the world could go in a different direction than everyone e it to. Maybe everyone thinks the market is going to the moon maybe it isnt. ; ;In October, he writes 25 possible surprises on shirt cardboard, and begins to conduct interviews with what he describes as focus groups; by November, he has a rough idea of what the surprises will be. In December, Byron is typically in good shape with a finalized set, though his wife claims he doesnt even know that Christmas and New Years are coming up. Finally, before the market opens on the first business day of the New Year, Byron releases his Ten Surprises to his many readers who agree, disagree, and voice their opinions on his predictions.; ;Ive had good years and bad years, he says. In 1993, 1994, and 1995, seven out of ten surprises were correct each year, which led to a ;s cover story featuring Byron as a Wall Street prognosticator who really could predict the future. As it happened, the following year was the worst year he ever had, which leads Byron to claim that some version of the ; curse works on his surprises, too.; ;Hes had other seven years, he says, and even one nine year in 2009 the year he joined Blackstone. ; ;I view this as the best job Ive ever had. Im doing work that I really want to do at this stage in my life, with terrific people who Im always learning from. Im interacting with our limited partners who are stimulating and informative. Since my responsibility is to understand whats going on around the world, I have the opportunity to constantly travel in order to be in locations where that is possible. ; ;[Blackstone President and COO] Tony James, who was shepherding the interview process, asked me to write a job description for the position, which I did. He read it and said, Where do I sign? This is what we want. What you want to do is e what we want you to do. Ive been at Blackstone now 5 years and nobody has ever come into my office and said, Dont do it that way. Do it this way. ; ;Im the oldest person at Blackstone by a large margin, and yet I have no trouble getting up in the morning and going to work. I dont think people look at me as some old guy, like Why are we hiring this fossil? or He is not in touch. I work hard to be in touch and stay current. ; ; ;In my first job, which was with an advertising agency, I was spending about 75% of my time doing things I didnt want to do, and 25% doing things I liked to do. At that time, and that was a long time ago, I said, Im going to get this to 75-25 the other way. ; ;One of the reasons I went to work at Blackstone was I thought it could be 90-10. By that time, I had learned what is productive and what is not. I try to spend my time on useful things. Im very careful about what meetings I go to, and I would say it is 90-10 now. ; ; ;First of all, we are more seriously diversified in a constructive way, so that is one difference. ;Second, we hire terrific people, but everyone does that. Something that we do that is different is that we give individuals a lot of room to do their own thing. That way, if you hire a winner, you find out early that he or she is a winner. I think that happens at other firms, but I dont think their programs of giving people intellectual freedom are as vigorous as ours. ; ;Its very satisfying to be recognized both for what I do intellectually and for what I represent as a person. To be thought of as a good person who is accessible, who is smart and does creative work is very satisfying, and thats what Im trying to be. ; ; ;When I wrote the surprises of 2008, Hillary Clinton was 14 points ahead of Barack Obama in the polls. One of my surprises that year was, Barack Obama becomes the 44; President in a landslide victory.; ;I read the ;, the ;, and the ;. I read them pretty thoroughly, and they are very helpful. Occasionally, Ill read the ; or something in it. I read ; the publication of the Council on Foreign Relations. I pretty religiously read the ;, Bob Silvers biweekly, which I think is really terrific, and Ive gotten a lot of ideas from there. ; ;I dont read fiction much anymore, but I do read nonfiction books. I usually dart around them. I dont read them cover-to-cover; I usually read what Im interested in. Sort of like when I go to a meal where I dont order the food myself, like a dinner: Ill eat what I like and wont eat what I dont like. I generally do that with books. ;Most people look at all the data and then draw their conclusions. I operate differently. I draw my conclusions and then try to find the data to prove it that means I go down a lot of blind alleys. I usually have a concept of whats happening and then I try to prove it. ; ;I spend a lot of time with data, but I dont start with data. I start with, as I said, the impression the intuitive view of what is happening and then I try to prove it. I would say nine out of ten times I cant prove it, but I learn something in each blind alley. By the time I come up with a conclusion, very often it is a good one and often its more imaginative than what the people who are data-driven come up with, because the people who are data-driven are prisoners of the data. They dont understand that the truth may be beyond the data. ; ;I try to connect the dots. When the dots lead in a certain direction, Im willing to jump ahead over 30 dots to get to the end, whereas a totally analytical approach wouldnt do that. They would wait until the 2;9 dot before they would do it and that is normally too late. ; ;If you did it by the dots, you would say the world is becoming a much more hostile place. We have problems in Israel and Gaza, the European Union might break up, and youve got ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Were going to have big water problems in China and India, weve got problems in the South China Sea, so the easy answer is to say that the world would be a very hostile place. You would have cyber-attacks everywhere and things like ;, and people would be afraid for their lives. You think of all of the situations where people have been killed this year, from Michael Brown to Eric Garner, the trajectory of where we are going is not good. But I would like to think that there will be some accommodation, as some believe, that the world will be a more harmonious place which would be a real surprise. I have implied that by saying there is no profit from evil. ; ;Lets look at Putin. Lets look at where this started. Everyone thought he wouldnt be ready for the Sochi Olympics, but the Sochi Olympics were a big hit. He was viewed as the world leader who could get something done. So he decided he is going to press his bet: hes going to go into Ukraine, and then hell be able to finance it because the price of oil is $100. Then the price of oil and everything goes against him. The world turns against him, the price of oil collapses and so forth.; ;The same is true in Iran. They are going after a nuclear weapon. They arent going to use a nuclear weapon. Nobody has ever used a nuclear weapon after the first time, so they are putting this country through the sanctions for something that no other country wants or believes in, and people will turn against the leadership. ; ;Maybe those things will start to reverse and people will start doing sensible things instead of thing that they think just enhance their viciousness. So if you ask me to loop ahead 30 years, where the conventional wisdom is that the world will be a more hostile place, I would say that the world becomes a more peaceful place.; ;/;To receive email notifications when press releases or Byron Wien\'s Market Commentaries are posted, sign up for email alerts here. ;This website uses cookies, including third-party cookies, which allow Blackstone to obtain information about your visit to the website.

It a good question and one that I answer a lot during my partner visits. It was also the topic of conversation when I first met with Reseller Trading Company D GmbH (R.T.C.), a brand new Xerox partner. The company was particularly interested to hear about the revenue opportunity from Xerox Supplies for non-Xerox printers a profitable alternative to selling OEM supplies to customers. During our first meeting, I presented the Xerox supplies for non-Xerox printers range to Ale Usula, Managing Partner at R.T.C., and e the benefits: high quality toner for consistent results, a 100% Lifetime Guarantee for risk-free printing and a huge range of cartridges for other major printer brands such as HP, Brother, Le & OKI. Usula could see the benefits of selling Xerox Supplies for non-Xerox printers immediately, but R.T.C. decision to add the range to their portfolio was not taken lightly. He e, customers have high quality e of the products we supply, so we needed to know these toner cartridges would meet both our quality standards and our customer demands before we added them to our range. R.T.C. focus is on small to medium sized businesses such as doctors, lawyers and accountants, providing competitive prices and outstanding customer service across a range of printing and office products. As a result of introducing the Xerox Supplies for non-Xerox printers range, I pleased to say that R.T.C. has developed a new, profitable and previously untapped revenue source generating 50% more revenue than planned. According to Usula, our customers e Xerox Supplies for non-Xerox printers first-hand, they see the print quality matches what they been used to and, of course, they also benefit from cost savings . We find customer satisfaction to be very high and repeat orders keep us busy. He continues, Xerox Supplies also provides reassurance to our clients. They get peace of mind that they are purchasing a high quality, low risk product. By adding Xerox supplies to its product portfolio,RTC's customers have increased overall purchases. R.T.C. is so committed to Xerox Supplies for non-Xerox printers that it has trained its entire sales force on the range which is a testament to the company confidence in the products and demonstrates their e customer service ethos. Usula concludes, worked with Bisar to ensure all our sales people were fully trained. They now completely understand how Xerox Supplies for non-Xerox printers perform and the benefits they bring. Being knowledgeable about the products we sell is an integral part of our customer service approach; it means we can demonstrate our e and confidence, answer customer inquiries and provide reassurance when required all of which benefits our customers. As a result of its recent successes, R.T.C. is now promoting Xerox Supplies for non-Xerox printers to its entire e customer base; as well as launching a campaign to attract customers seeking a cost-effective alternative following another OEM recent announcement about the cost of its printer supplies. I pleased to say that by adding this new product line to their business, R.T.C. has uncovered a new source of low risk, repeatable revenue one that I very much hope will continue to grow in the future.

Innovation in marketing is perhaps more important than product innovation. Yet in the business plans I see, the marketing content and budgets are smaller than ever. More than just spending, you need to create an in this digital age which sets you apart from the banner ads, email blasts, and old-school websites out there today. According to a classic book by Rick Mathieson, these have morphed into a digital universe of augmented reality, , and virtual worlds that are highly personalized and uniquely shareable. His title characterizes the challenge of demanding attention from a new generation of consumers who want what they want, when they want it, and where they want it. Here are the new marketing rules I support: Innovative marketing starts with customer insights culled from painstaking research into who your customers are, and how they use digital media. Then it time to innovate through the channels or platforms that are relevant. Digital quite simply is not for repurposing content that e in other channels. It about re-imagining content to create blockbuster e that cannot be attained through any other medium. Create new online communities and , rather than joining e ones. Ask why it should be, and why customers should care. Then give them a reason to keep coming back. Keep it real, social, and events-based. Remember Hollywood secrets. Your brand is a story; tell it. Accentuate personalized, own-able, and sharable. is an outcome, not a strategy. Make people passionate and emotional and they will buy. Several companies, including Mastercard, Coca-Cola, and Doritos have let customers build commercials and design contests, with big rewards for the customer and for the company. That giving up control, with some risk, to get control. Another approach you may remember was American Family Publishers setting revenue records with their sweepstakes and Ed McMahon showing up at the doorstep of multi-million dollar winners with an oversized check and a bottle of champagne. This strategy made AFP a household name and engaged countless people to participate. Games are immersive, but shouldn be just a diversion. They need to drive home the value proposition. Don forget to include a call to action leading people to the ne step of the buying process. Startups need to realize that products are the jumping-off point for building relationships with customers. Digital channels enable you to turn products into on-demand services that help customers reach their goals, and add value. Xerox works with you to strengthen the communications thread in each of your customers journeys. In addition to thinking of mobile as a new advertising distribution platform, remember it far more powerful as a response, or mechanism, to commercial messages we e in other media print, broadcast, and more. Social retailing is the new approach, where real-world shopping allows customers to connect with friends outside the store, and try on virtual versions of fashions friends might recommend. Be sure your in-store services add value. The new generation of advertising enables the creation of an Internet banner ad to fit each viewer age, gender, location, personal interests, past purchase behavior, and much more. The trick is to do this without being invasive. Remember everything you do, or don do, in the digital world is visible to your customers, and everything they say about you is visible on demand, all over the world. That means marketing can no longer be an afterthought, or something you can postpone until later, when you have more resources. Without effective and innovative marketing, you won have a successful business.

b'https://www.blackstone.com/media/blogs/article/online-video-the-media-industry-s-new-frontier',9,25,243.181,3,296.949,9,25,18,1157,64,1,"b'The following interview was conducted with Ken Allen, a Vice President in Blackstones Advisory Practice, who leads Blackstones coverage of the Digital Media sector.; ; ;The advertising landscape is undergoing a dramatic transformation that began over a decade ago and that continues today. We have gone from a world in which advertising was once broadcast to large, homogeneous audiences to one where highly tailored messages are targeted to specific individuals through multiple digital channels, often simultaneously. ;The chart below shows the broad transformation that has taken place in the U.S. market. As the online marketing channel has become more prevalent, increasing from only 5% of the total market in 2000 to 16% today, print has similarly e a dramatic decline, decreasing from a 38% share in 2000 to 22% today. Underpinning these share shifts is the rise of online advertising technologies, in particular, Paid Search and Display advertising.;Importantly, as the previous data shows and contrary to the intuition of many, TV advertisings share has actually increased in the past decade, implying that online has far from cannibalized TV as an advertising medium. Television advertisings resilience is primarily due to the fact that TV advertising, at least historically, has been fundamentally different from online advertising. Online advertising is static in nature Paid Search ads appear in the sidebar of our search results; banner ads appear as we read articles and browse web pages. The Internet as we know it, to a large degree, has been a substitute for print media, such as the Yellow Pages, newspapers and magazines. But it has not been a replacement for TV. The advertising share shift has followed accordingly, with online advertising substituting for print advertising. This dynamic is starting to change, however, as Online Video technologies continue to proliferate and as Internet Video becomes an increasingly viable substitute for television.;Another major trend we are seeing is that advertising is becoming more and more data-driven, in turn enabling a much higher degree of targeting. A tremendous amount of data about our tastes and preferences is being generated through each interaction we have with our digital world, including web browsing, using our mobile phones, and using social media platforms. This data is increasingly being analyzed in new ways to target each of us with the ad that has the highest probability of achieving a response from us at a particular point in time. That ad could be shown as part of our search results, in the banner ads we are all familiar with, in the sidebar ads we see in Facebook, and, increasingly, through Online Video.;Despite the significant e of the online advertising channel over the past 10 years, the majority of online advertising today continues to be related to searching for specific products or services. In other words, advertising online is typically targeted based on our intent; we search for something online, and we see advertisements that are related to what we were looking for. This intent-based advertising is very different from what we typically e when we see television commercials. Rather, TV advertising is generally more focused on the branding of a product or service. Such advertising is meant to connect with viewers on an emotional level and help customers both e and targeted form a connection with a brand. By its very nature, television advertising is also less targeted and more focused on reaching a wide audience.;The promise of Online Video is that advertisers can have the best of both worlds; e.g., high-impact branding that can be micro-targeted to a specific audience segment. Until only recently, however, bandwidth limitations prohibited streaming video content and advertisements from reaching our desktops, mobile phones, or TVs. With the massive investment that has been made in IP infrastructure over the past decade, bandwidth has finally gotten to the point where high-definition video is viewable through the various endpoints we use to connect to the Internet. This, in turn, has led to the relatively recent e of Online Video services, including Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Apple TV, and Amazon. ;Another key driver here is the effectiveness of Online Video advertising, which has been increasingly documented, whether you are looking at recall rates, viewing time, likability, etc. This performance has led to CPMs that are on par with, or greater than, what we see in the offline world with TV. Due to these underlying trends, we believe branding dollars will shift away from television andinto the Online Video channel over time, much in the same way that advertising dollars shifted away from print and into online channels over the past decade.;Most forecasts for Online Video advertising assume a roughly $2billion market today growing at nearly 40% per year to over $7billion by 2015. I think this forecast, which is primarily determined by taking todays market and growing it at a constant rate into the future, potentially understates the long-run market size by a significant amount. The chart below shows the untapped potential we see in this market. As the chart on the left shows, 82% of offline advertising dollars in the U.S. are directed at branding efforts (defined as TV, radio, print, and outdoor channels), versus only 18% targeted at direct response channels (defined as direct mail and directories). This ratio inverts in the online world, with only 39% of the online dollars targeted at branding (Display and Video). In other words, the branding gap in the online world, based on offline ratios, is appro $13 billion in the U.S. alone. Video is particularly well suited to target this gap, in our view. When combined with the $2 billion being spent on Online Video advertising today, this implies a $15 billion potentially addressable market.;Additional support for this untapped market potential is provided by the chart on the right, which compares the number of Online Video impressions having advertisements to those without advertisements. Today, only 12% of the total videos online currently have ads. The monetization of only 15% of the unfilled inventory, at current average CPM rates, again implies a nearly $15 billion potential market by 2015. Clearly, the current low ad penetration is partially due to the high proportion of user-generated content; for such content we would not e to see high ad penetration rates. But the low penetration is also a function of the nascence of this market. Over time, as the quality of content improves and monetization techniques such as video ad networks and ad insertion technologies proliferate, we would e to see much higher ad penetration rates and monetization of this largely untapped opportunity.;I believe that the Online Video industry has the potential to impact the TV industry in the same way that the Internet impacted the print industry. We see many of the same precursors: dramatically improved bandwidth, new and disruptive technologies (YouTube, Hulu, etc.), the fragmentation of content, and new ways of accessing content that go over-the-top of traditional, entrenched distribution channels. Innovation is occurring at a dizzying pace right now and I believe it is only a matter of time before we see an over-the-top video platform become successfully integrated with the television.;Given these trends, there is a war going on right now among players in the ecosystem to try and lock up two of the most strategic elements of the video value chain: the end-point (TV, set-top-box, mobile handset, etc.) and the content that is distributed to that end-point. Much of the partnership and acquisition activity we are observing among the major players in the ecosystem is aimed at ma share of content by solidifying rights to use that content. Further, many of the distributors of Online Video are beginning to create proprietary content of their own. E include Google, which is reportedly spending hundreds of millions of dollars to create original content on YouTube, and Netflix, which is doing the same through its streaming video service. The end-point is a similarly prized battleground, where the various service providers are fighting to gain a large strategic footprint.;In addition to the larger players, we also believe a new crop of technology providers are showing tremendous potential, such as the video ad networks, ad insertion players, and online video platforms (OVPs), which are increasingly enabling the ecosystem with new and innovative technologies.;The losers will be incumbents who elect not to embrace these trends. We have seen such a phenomenon before with other types of media: first with print, then with books and music.

The trick was making getting a long-run at the end and that is e what happened as Keselowski piloted his No. 22 Fitzgerald Ford Mustang to victory after passing Kyle Busch with 15 to go. The three-wide pass was the fourth and final time Keselowski would have to work his way to the front. He pulled a simlar maneuver on the final lap of Stage 2 to ear the segment win as well. Other than Keselowski, it was a midland effort for the Ford crew as series regulars Ryan Reed and Cole Custer both struggled throughout the night. The duo came home 12th and 19th, respectively. Custer currently stands si in the driver standings and Reed is ninth as the teams head to the regular season finale ne Saturday at Chicagoland Speedway. Chevy Elliott Sadler clinched the regular season points championship with his fifth place finish at Richmond. 1st - Brad Keselowski - Ryan Reed - Cole Custer - Casey Mears (Busch) is a great racer. When you can race with him you know you are having a good day, especially in this series. The Fitzgerald Glider Parts Ford Mustang had a lot of speed on the long runs. We weren quite where we wanted to be on the short runs but good enough to be right there. We just hung with him and got the long runs and we were able to pounce. That is a testament to the team. Burton was asking me if it was the set up or the driver. I think it was both. I am happy to get another win in this series, it is a lot of fun and the first one in these new bodies. At least you know it isn an aero advantage. A great night at Richmond. I am proud of my whole team. are a lot of other places we could be in the world and a lot of other stuff going on. I am glad I get to be here and glad they are here with us and I appreciate their support. Thank you everybody. am not a very patient guy. Being behind the wheel is no fun knowing that you have to be smooth and steady every lap to have a shot at winning it. The team gave me a great car and were real good about being patient and here we are in victory lane. That is really cool. knew Kyle wasn going to just let me have it so I had to force something there. Whenever you make a pass for the lead and the win by going three-wide it is really damn cool. I am glad to be able to do that with the Fitzgerald Ford. It is good to be back in victory lane. way the cars are, you can run them hard the whole run or you will just have nothing left. I wanted to see what I needed on the short run in case we got one there at the end. I had to push a little bit. Then it was time to settle in and see if the long run came and it did and we were able to e at the end. just wish I could e better than I know how. I wish I could have somebody riding with me and kind of e what it is like and see things through my view. I guess that is the beauty of the helmet cam we are trying to put in. From my view that was one of those race wins that was e personally gratifying. To know you are probably not as good as someone on the short run and just try to wear them down every lap and knowing that if you can get a long run you got a shot and it and we did - we got a long run and I still had to make the right moves. It was a grinder, that is what that race was. A grinder in a good way. I think it shows the beauty of having the stages with the short and long runs because you see the races really just break apart like that one did where someone is good on the short side and someone is good on the long side. It is also part of the beauty of this track. You really have to focus in on being smooth and smart with how you use your car and manage it. That makes for passing at the lead at the end. It was really a thriller of a race at the end. don know. That was an hour ago. I left it all out on the field. I don really remember what happened there specifically. I knew I needed every lap I had and I think I ended up making the pass with 11 to go. If the race had been 11 laps shorter I don think I would have gotten it. corner. You come off the corner and the spotter the spotter keys the mic for the simplest of things and you think, no, here it is, but thankfully it wasn. That is the dynamic of racing. That is why you never know who is going to win these things. So many different things can flip the field so to speak. This field flipped a couple times with the long and short runs and strategy on the stages. That was fun to be a part of. is a great question. You have probably heard me say this, people that have been in this room for the majority of the year have heard me say this, for those here that haven I would say to them and anyone that doesn really understand the significance of the owner championship I would say this. As the driver, I am the face of the team, kind of like a quarterback. But the team is much greater than me. I hold an important position but it is just one position. To be successful it takes people that you see, whether it is the pit crew or crew chiefs, but for every person you see there are another 5-10 that you don see. Those guys are looking for any bit of validation possible. They know that with this program a drivers championship is impossible. That isn how this is set up and doesn fit in the investment portfolio that way. But an owners championship is possible and it is validation, not just for them, but validation for their families and sponsors that support our teams and it is as significant internally as a drivers championship. Much like anyone else in the profession there are sacrifices made to be here. Just because it might not be a driver that wins the championship doesn mean the car prep is any easier to do. It doesn mean they take more days off. They still miss their daughters dance and sons baseball game like everyone else does. When you do those things and make those sacrifices to be the best you can be, you want to know they are worth something. The championship is their validation. That is something that I can feel proud to be a part of. I understand that the guy that works in the shop not being visible to the fans and media that it makes it hard to understand the significance of it but in reality that is what it is. Those are the people that really make the sport. I do about two percent of the work on any given weekend and get about 98-percent of the credit. That is unfair to those guys. They are the ones that are working six and seven days a week and they are the ones that are in here in the garage when it is a 16-hour day. I think today was a 16 or 17-hour day. For them, that is what they fight for. Not just the wins but an owner's championship as a signal of a season long accomplishment. think I was watching too many Ken Block videos. Had anyone else done that before? No? Well, there will probably be a rule you can do that anymore after that one. Better to be a rule maker than a rule breaker. I knew I wasn going to hit him but I just really wanted to see Rutledge (Wood) and his face and I saw it and it was priceless. I needed the helmet can for that one. I had fun with it. Winning is supposed to be fun. It is a really personally gratifying win. You always want to showcase that to the fans when you have a moment like that. is two different conversations between this series and the Cup series. The decision that was made I guess about seven years ago now for Team Penske to compete in this series was to develop crew members, pit crew guys, engineers, etc. to make it to the Cup level with the philosophy that Roger Penske would like to promote from within than hire from the outside. He would rather have a draft with 25 players than go to free agency and buy the best five players. Fundamentally that is the e opposite of where the Gibbs program is. We know at any given moment when we win, we are winning with less e and less investment. That is maybe hard to e because obviously Roger is very well off financially but that isn how the program works. We know every year when we compete here against the Gibbs cars that we are entering the arena with at least one arm tied behind our back to them. So, when you do beat them, you have to really earn it. Today was one of those days. Let alone the fact that the Toyota are as strong as they are. It is just part of the equation for us. We accept that. We are hopeful that those people will graduate to the Cup level and most of them have. The three crew chiefs on the Cup car right now, all three at one time crew chiefed on the 22 Xfinity car. That is something we are very, very proud of. I think we are looking to continue that trend. That is just the crew chiefs. The car chiefs, engineers, they have all played at a level in that team. It is the culture we look to have and there is a little bit of a handicap to it. Some people probably don want to hear that but it is the truth of the matter. It makes the dynamic of racing Kyle even tougher because we know that is not the decision that group has made. It can be frustrating when you get beat knowing that. But on the other side it is also at times more rewarding like today. We know our program is behind their program in a lot of ways so when you win you feel a high level of personal gratification. , obviously we have our best people at the Cup level and we are playing all of our starters so to speak. That conversation is more parallel between the two series. Between that series and that series. Does that answer your question? , you know, drivers have - whether they want to admit it or not - roll through confidence waves. I think every professional athlete does to some e. So this series gets kind of made fun of sometimes as an ego play for Cup drivers. Whether you want to call it ego or confidence, this series is great for building a Cup drivers confidence. That is the same whether you are 19 or 20 and just getting started at the Cup or Xfinity level or if you are 33 like I am. I know I am racing Kyle. I know we are about the same age. I know he is in that caliber of equipment and that competition. That is an element he adds. Anybody that beats Kyle gains a lot of confidence. haven really thought of it that way. We probably could have won two or three more races. We were right there to win Loudon but had a pit stop issue. I think we were in the lead at Loudon when we had that issue. Daytona we race very strong and led a bunch and got caught up in a wreck there at the end. There have been a number of those scenarios. I am still proud of how we rand and the effort we put in and 10 races feels good to me. It is a good amount of races. I would feel a little greedy if I ran more than that anyway. I think seven probably doesn feel quite right to me but I have enjoyed the season I have had and keeping the roots to this series. That is important to the team members and sponsors. 10 races feels good to me from a workload standpoint. It is something I really enjoy.""",ford,25,85,396.959,0.3,-0.25,n,y,n,n,n,-0.0316215677,0.0086387164,-0.0537035271,-0.0598326747,-0.0711375346,10986,1228,11.1778627344,79.9,y,n,y,y,n,2,5,3,1,4

We going to answer that question with another question, 25 in fact. When you evaluate ECM systems, use these as discussion points to identify solutions that bring the important features and capabilities you should e in a truly comprehensive system. 1. Can the ECM solution scale up or down based on business needs? . Can it help your organization solve document-centric business problems by digitizing, processing, managing and sharing content? . Does it tightly integrate with multi-function devices for ad-hoc and conte-aware scanning? . Does it give you an ecosystem of products to facilitate access to content through mobile and cloud? deal with large volumes of content to support their business processes. Whether you want to automate invoice processing, streamline accounts payable or some other need, it all starts with paper. . Does the ECM solution support a wide range of scanning needs with tools for both distributed and centralized capture? . Does it support ad-hoc scanning of hard copy content into business processes? . Can it help digitize high volumes of paper through enterprise-grade capture? . Does it offer a mobile client to capture business content through the convenience of mobile devices? . How about scan-to-process and scan-to-archive for a wide range of organizational imaging needs? hardcopy content is digitized, the ne step in the process usually involves managing that information. Once content is organized, you want data-centric applications and a unified repository where all your business-critical information is stored. Users shouldn have to worry about logging into multiple systems, running around looking for information or sending multiple emails to gather insight. Everything is at their fingertips. All they have to do is access the ECM repository to look for content either through keywords or even using a te within the document. 10.Can users organize content to folders? . Can it define unique properties such as invoice number or amount or student or employee ID, to support inde and search? content plays a role within a business process, it often requires collaboration among knowledge workers. A truly comprehensive solution offers a suite of collaboration capabilities. Ask if a particular ECM solution allows users to: 12. Instantly share information across distributed workgroups? . Improve communication and knowledge transfer with wikis, blogs and dedicated workspaces? . Use document routing and approval for sign-off? . Enable document-level collaboration to help knowledge workers make informed decisions? can either live by itself or play a role within a process in conjunction with business rules management to automate complex business processes. 16. Can users work with their own content with little to no programming? . Does the ECM package offer e-forms, business rules and advanced business process management help meet automation goals in a matter of days instead of months or years? aspects of every content management system are compliance and security. 18.Does the ECM solution provide robust mechanisms to secure your digital assets, through user and group-based access? . Can it automate content retention and disposition? . Does it allow engagement with e users and sharing information via secure access? . Ask about audit trails to track usage. . Also ask about integration support with Microsoft E servers, so employees can use their Windows credentials to authenticate against the ECM system. This step helps avoid unauthorized access and automates login procedures. eventually want to retrieve content that they stored in the repository. In some complex scenarios, this access could be within the conte of a third party application. For e, you might want to access sales orders from the SalesForce application. 23. Does the ECM application provide easy, intuitive means to let enterprise applications talk to each other? . Does your ECM solution allow access to business-critical content both online and offline, through desktop browsers or mobile devices? . How about through the cloud? By the time you answered these questions, you have a pretty good idea whether or not the ECM solution brings enough to the table. We recommend putting to the test to find out if it answers all your questions.

Take apps, for instance. We use them all the time on phones and tablets. Now innovation brings more apps into the world of MFP devices, documents and workflow. Lots more. , the MFP-embedded app market is diversifying by taking on more specialized tasks notes BPO Media senior analyst, Patricia Ames . Ne-gen device vendors have introduced apps to MFPs in ways that reflect how we to work for convenience, and how we to work to be successful. Now apps can be embedded in or downloaded to devices for purposes as diverse as: MFP-embedded applications reflect vendors response to the digital workplace, and it a good fit. An app-centric, solutions-enabled device environment contributes to your digital transformation by making it easier to use devices as part of digital workflows to cloud and other platforms and applications. Again, from Patricia Ames, on a foundation of integration and e, the latest apps are interfacing with email, cloud services, ECM platforms, workflow solutions, and line-of-business applications, and other key systems utilized by many businesses to help optimize processes. Apps also give you and your vendors the means to easily customize and optimize your device investments to squeeze every last bit of value out of them. The impact on productivity quickly accumulates with every user and every app, every workday. App automation reduces risk of human error, and avoided risk has its own value. Some newly released printers and multi-function devices feature a user interface that behaves more like a mobile device with gesture-based interaction. To further simplify the interface, some vendors have made the most frequently used features available on the first screen up for common functions like printing and scanning. People like a good device interface, but that goal can be a moving target. Working within an app-based environment gives you agility and makes it possible to e the relevancy and use of your fleet technology. It coa longer, useful life out of your investment. Sometimes intelligent multifunction devices come preloaded with standard apps that can be customized to your workflow. Preloaded apps optimize office efficiency by taking on more of the things technology was meant to do. Apps like Quick Scan to Email, Scan to/Print from DropBox and Scan to/Print from Office 365 become welcome parts of the daily routine, and many employees can take advantage of these workflow enhancements. There will quickly come a time when someone wants to download a new app to the device from the MPS provider app gallery, and this should be easy. With the touch of a button, users would lightweight, serverless apps to a multifunction printer to increase user productivity and shorten everyday tasks. The new standard is to empower users to e device functionality simply by adding capabilities from an app gallery. This convenience lets you improve how you work today and easily adapt to an unknown future. If you haven tried the smart-apps-and-MFP combination, you should. The first step is to speak to your MPS provider. Some things to talk include One easily located spot on a touchscreen UI for access to all scan destinations and features. This where the future hits the road. Through an app, someone scans a document and receives a translated print and email notification. You can also forward a digital image from both iOS and Android mobile devices or PCs for translation. Employees speed through tasks by saving common settings as presets for simple, single-touch job set-up. Individuals or groups enter a user ID and password once, and then get fast, secure access to task-specific presets and commonly used apps on a personalized home screen. Employees go right to the tools they need to get work done. That MFP device isn just for paper anymore. It not just about copies, prints or heaven forbid, fa! It about making documents safe, users productive and workflow efficient. The app environments on some of takes a giant leap in that direction. Users benefit when innovation brings more apps into the world of MFP devices, documents and workflow.

If you don innovate the way you work and connect, you risk being left behind, and that includes being abandoned by customers and business partners. You may also drag down teams of knowledge workers and support staff who use documents day in and day out to drive the business and support customers. Digital Transformation (DX) is not going away, but it doesn have to be intimidating. In the digital workplace, it real things like workflow automation, analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and guess what? So do . Today, digital printers and multifunction devices perform at the intersection of analog and digital and tie into the processes that work teams and organizations use to produce, share and communicate information. In the hands of a strategic MPS vendor, devices become conduits for automated workflow, productivity, operational efficiency, information security and more. If DX is on your priority list or at least on your radar, you can look to your MPS partner to guide you along the DX journey. Your digitally enabled workforce might be mobile and customer-facing, or they might work with sensitive information outside the cubicle. Wherever employees go and whatever they do, digital devices, including intelligent MFPs, are part of the new digital workplace and the DX shaping it. The untethered, digital worker can take along the documents needed to do the work. They just don have to print and carry them. Just it. DX has contributed to the e accessibility and flow of information, and MFPs have kept up. The users tap, swipe and pinch their way through tasks and functions with mobile-like ease. Work from anywhere when mobility has been baked into device design: Don assume DX is just about tablets and smartphones.

Multifunction peripherals belong to the Internet of Things, putting them at the forefront of all things digital. With MPS and MFPs, you tap the potential of DX faster to achieve new levels of productivity. Employees work the way they prefer from any device with ma security and easy connectivity to and from both cloud and network-based locations. Making customers, employees and shareholders happy and rewarded is an outcome worth pursuing through DX combined with Managed Print and Document Services.

Video chat is well-positioned to meet that need better than telephone support, because customer service agents can visually guide customers and help with complex solutions more easily. Gartner predicts that 33 percent of all customer service interactions will still require live agent support in 2017, and an equal number said they would like to use video chat with customer support questions, according to call center solutions provider, Talkdesk. In recent , the business priority of improving customer service ranks just behind increasing productivity and reducing printing costs within organizations. Enhanced technologies in customer service along with best-in-class innovations in managed print both can positively impact the bottom line from a productivity standpoint. Consumers don want a sales rep hounding them, but sometimes they would like assistance with the buying decision. Video chat strikes the right balance, because customers can browse a web site on their own and then connect with a sales agent over video chat when they have a question. As sales is an integral part of every company growth plans in alignment with larger business trends, the top departments that SMBs most want to improve their workflow ranks sales after IT, finance and operations. The association between workflows, productivity levels and cost savings are highly emphasized objectives across the organization Reducing e has two sides: There is the customer-facing side of cost savings, and there the operational side. Small and mid-size businesses are always seeking new ways to save money. Cutting costs is two-sided, 1. Customer facing and 2. Operational via @JTRipton On the operations side, enhanced usage of innovative office technology dramatically reduces e. Costly sales meetings with complex or sensitive documents can be reduced by handling some of these meetings over video chat and utilizing Xerox mobile print to share documents saving time and effort. Businesses can rely more easily on remote workers without worrying about a loss of accountability or the isolation of these employees from the rest of the team. From any mobile device to any brand of printer, raises your productivity everywhere your business takes you it helps your workforce be more efficient. It provides a high level of security to ensure information stays confidential and eliminates the need to rely on others to print sensitive documents involved in the sales process. Many small businesses use Microsoft Office 365, QuickBooks, Salesforce, SAP, Concur as part of their operations. However, when it comes to eliminating tasks in the entire process, from end-to-end, only one automation tool has it down to a science in three easy steps. Service helps SMBs solve the often tedious scanning-to-application pain point for their customers with a simple, yet powerful workflow automation tool. For many SMBs, this is an important first step to automate workflows. Xerox Web Capture Service is the only solution that automates and scans a document for immediate use without additional steps of creating files, renaming documents and importing it to an application. Sold only through , Web Capture Service can be used with any scanner regardless of brand and works with most web applications. A small law office, for e, can now print contracts, affidavits, wills and briefs on site and in real time, without sacrificing quality and accuracy. Additionally, that law firm can digitize client proposals and contracts, sending these files to their legal team in the courthouse and creating te-searchable versions for easy archiving. Xerox offers simple setup and high-productivity tools such as two-sided, single-pass scanning. The MFP also features a 5-inch, app-based, tablet-like touchscreen that offers scan preview, editing features, intuitive navigation and the ability to customize workflows. Ample paper capacity of up to 850-sheets and new Super-Fine EA toner deliver the type of performance typically seen in large enterprise environments.

Rightly so. A good MPS program should lead to optimizing document workflow and streamlining processes. But multifunction printers (MFPs) remain critical to that objective. In fact, they downright essential for digitizing content, automating workflow and keeping workers productive. If you want devices that are more than just paper output portals, what should you look for? You might consider the evaluation criteria e by the document imaging professionals at Buyers Laboratory LLC (BLI.) When the time comes to evaluate devices, consider these ten factors. BLI did. reason digital devices and digital workflow go hand in hand is scanning the on-ramp to digital workflows. is a key part of office workflows, noted Marlene Orr, Senior Analyst, Printers/A4 MFPs, BLI. business processes and customer service depend on documents, device downtime is not an option. workers want to know an MFP is ready to go when they need it most, said Pete Emory, Director of Research and Lab Services US/Asia, BLI. It no surprise that reliability is a major part of BLI lab testing. In fact, they perform the most e reliability testing in the industry. they have the right capabilities, MFP devices can contribute to your enterprise sustainability goals. for a device with smart settings in the drivers that help conserve toner. look for the ability to print multiple pages per sheet and duplex to reduce paper use. the device family use a similar interface across product line? When an MFP line uses a common interface, users won be interrupted or delayed in their work when they move from one department or location to another. They will still be familiar with touch screens and can quickly move on with their document task. you have to stop one thing to check on another, it slows you down. For e, how often do users have to manually check toner or paper before sending jobs, so they don worry about running out? Or consider the delays of investigating how many jobs are ahead of them, so users will know if they need to print to a different device if they on a deadline. What if the MFP offered driver views from the desktop? Users could get detailed paper status without having to leave their desk and interrupt their work. -to-person communications can make the difference when users need to know details about their print job. When the device takes the initiative, that even better. Look for communication capabilities like these: a device has this capability, it ensures more people can use the resource without delay or interruption.

One salesperson reckons education could be a rewarding market, another wants to target manufacturing, and a third sees huge potential with local small businesses. So who is right? When large enterprises target vertical markets, they often devote whole teams to a sector, getting e results. And, with their ability to hone in at a personal level, smaller businesses can enjoy spectacular success too. We all like the idea of hitting a marketing sweet spot with a near-identical and repeatable approach that works well for every customer. But vertical markets are also easy to get wrong, which wastes your precious resources. In this article, we look at how to go about targeting the right sectors in the right way. Marketing to verticals is a long game. Start with some basics. In the broadest terms, let think about six vertical markets you could be targeting: . Central government . Local government . Health . Not for profit . Large corporations and . Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) Central government can include the armed forces, emergency services or agencies as well as the main Government bodies around the UK Local Government can mean councils and schools Health could be a mi of state-run or private institutions The Not for Profit sector can include a wide range of charities and organizations Private companies of all sizes operate in diverse markets, such as retail, finance, utilities, automotive, engineering, manufacturing, food, drink and much more. It easy for our eyes to glaze over at this point. The options are mesmerizing. But stay with me. It easy to address any of these vertical markets in the wrong way. For e, a company could send a flyer or email to thousands of schools with the headline solutions for education. But your marketing return on investment will be poor if your actual sales pitch/story is the same as everyone else. The secret to success in vertical markets is in understanding each sector and then tailoring your end-to-end proposition to fit their personal needs. Sectors will also be different to each other in other ways, for e: The products and services that interest them most Their reasons for buying one product over another (eg. cost, service, quality, durability, speed of delivery, environmental benefits, etc.) Their purchasing process timeline and who makes the decisions How many suppliers they willing to deal with How they prefer to buy (eg. catalogues, websites or over the phone) How long their contracts tend to last What style of account management they prefer Do they prefer to buy local or national Are they part of a larger framework they must buy from You need to meet each of these requirements to get your voice heard and have any chance of building a sustainable operation. Of course, there will be variations between customers, but you encounter many similarities within a sector. Before selecting vertical markets to target, take a close look at your e customers and your best accounts. In which sectors do they operate? What have you learned already about that sector that could be used to reach other businesses within the same industry? Get a team together to identify what you know and what you need to find out. Rather than attempting to target a completely new sector and face a mountainous learning curve it far easier to build on your own strengths and knowledge. Perhaps there are one or two industries in which you had success and where you only a few steps away from being a specialist? If so, these are your obvious starting points. Success in vertical markets requires a strategic plan and commitment (see ). You need the right sales force, the right marketing, the right operational requirements for your audience, the right vendor and, naturally, the right product range. Without these, you may win piecemeal business but you never make that strategic jump into being a big player in that market. Once you got the basics right, you be in a far stronger position to win, surprise and delight your target customers because they recognize you understand them and you built your business operations and approach around them. Finally, remember that marketing to verticals is a long game. Adding to your industry knowledge takes time, building up your reputation within a sector will demand consistency and winning lengthy contracts doesn happen overnight. But the more effort you invest, the deeper your business relationships in vertical markets are likely to be and the greater the returns over time.

Even so, only a small percentage of businesses today have truly optimized their print and document environment to e beyond the print ecosystem into true process optimization. Digital transformation sounds great, but without the proper document infrastructure and software tools, there are limits as to what businesses can accomplish in pursuit of a digital workflow strategy. Digitizing e paper-based information is a crucial step in the overall process. Unfortunately, businesses often fail to recognize that fully enabled digital workflow involves much more than simply scanning paper documents and converting those into electronic files. A truly integrated capture and workflow solution allows businesses to work with digital content in much more effective ways to minimize paper-intensive processes and free up valuable business information. Businesses face a multitude of challenges when it comes to managing information. The problem lies in two basic areas: the growing amount of content created and consumed, and changes occurring both in the structure of the workforce and in the way business is conducted. Knowledge workers are creating massive amounts of content, and in today increasingly mobile business environment, information must be made accessible on a 24/7 basis to enable employees to get work done when and where they want. Across all functional areas of the organization, knowledge workers spend the most time on document tasks related to the dissemination of information. But while the office is moving ever closer to a digital ecosystem, much of today business content remains trapped in paper-based documents, which has a significant impact on knowledge worker productivity. Research from IDC (March 2016) shows that knowledge workers spend an average of 136 minutes a week searching for documents, costing their organizations appro $17.6 per week or $916.2 per year per knowledge worker. How can MPS software help bridge the gap between paper and digital? Paper itself is a hindrance to driving efficiencies into many current work processes, and MPS by its very nature is a program that seeks to optimize the use of paper. Today, MPS is positioned primarily as a means for reducing paper consumption through the consolidation of print devices and controlled access to printing capabilities. But service providers should also help customers understand how capture and workflow solutions can help stop the spread of non-essential paper in the office environment. The distributed network MFP combined with scanning software provides the ability to convert paper to digital format at the most opportune point in the overall process, while specifically addressing key areas to enable improved digital workflow: content accessibility, collaboration, security, and integrity. This is how MPS can drive real efficiencies into e business processes, and e why workflow software and intelligent scanning should be considered a core capability of any MPS solution. Scanning is the fundamental component of any paper-to-digital conversion strategy. However, businesses need guidance when it comes to designing and implementing an effective scan and workflow solution. Ad hoc scanning has become pervasive in today office environment, which in many cases only contributes to the growing list of challenges associated with information management. Mountains of paper documents are scanned and converted into static digital files that cannot be manipulated, making it virtually impossible to edit or collaborate the way users can with hardcopy documents.

Even so, only a small percentage of businesses today have truly optimized their print and document environment to e beyond the print ecosystem into true process optimization. Digital transformation sounds great, but without the proper document infrastructure and software tools, there are limits as to what businesses can accomplish in pursuit of a digital workflow strategy. Digitizing e paper-based information is a crucial step in the overall process. Unfortunately, businesses often fail to recognize that fully enabled involves much more than simply scanning paper documents and converting those into electronic files. A truly integrated capture and workflow solution allows businesses to work with digital content in much more effective ways to minimize paper-intensive processes and free up valuable business information. Businesses face a multitude of challenges when it comes to managing information. The problem lies in two basic areas: the growing amount of content created and consumed, and changes occurring both in the structure of the workforce and in the way business is conducted. Help your customers boost productivity and save money with these three little letters. Source: idc.com Knowledge workers are creating massive amounts of content, and in today increasingly mobile business environment, information must be made accessible on a 24/7 basis to enable employees to get work done when and where they want. Across all functional areas of the organization, knowledge workers spend the most time on document tasks related to the dissemination of information. But while the office is moving ever closer to a digital ecosystem, much of today business content remains trapped in paper-based documents, which has a significant impact on knowledge worker productivity. Research from IDC shows that knowledge workers spend an average of 136 minutes a week searching for documents, costing their organizations appro $17.6 per week or $916.2 per year per knowledge worker. How can managed print services (MPS) software help bridge the gap between paper and digital? Paper itself is a hindrance to driving efficiencies into many current work processes, and MPS by its very nature is a program that seeks to optimize the use of paper. Today, MPS is positioned primarily as a means for reducing paper consumption through the consolidation of print devices and controlled access to printing capabilities. But service providers should also help customers understand how capture and workflow solutions can help stop the spread of non-essential paper in the office environment. The distributed network MFP combined with scanning software provides the ability to convert paper to digital format at the most opportune point in the overall process, while specifically addressing key areas to enable improved digital workflow: content accessibility, collaboration, security, and integrity. This is how MPS can drive real efficiencies into e business processes, and e why workflow software and intelligent scanning should be considered a core capability of any MPS solution. Scanning is the fundamental component of any paper-to-digital conversion strategy. However, businesses need guidance when it comes to designing and implementing an effective scan and workflow solution. Ad hoc scanning has become pervasive in today office environment, which in many cases only contributes to the growing list of challenges associated with information management. Mountains of paper documents are scanned and converted into static digital files that cannot be manipulated, making it virtually impossible to edit or collaborate the way users can with hardcopy documents. This can lead to significant drain on worker productivity. Paper is the original collaboration tool, and the most effective digital conversion solutions should enable users to work with electronic documents in the same manner as they have with paper, with the ability to annotate, collate, and collaborate. The scan/capture solution should leverage OCR technology to create editable, searchable files combined with the intelligence to scan directly into e document repositories, applications, and document management systems.

With thousands of views on their videos, , a Xerox channel partner based in Colorado, has refined a winning strategy. We asked them to share insights to help other Xerox channel partners reap the benefits of video. First, we asked Terry for recommendations on the technical side of video creation and in the ne blog we learn Ben tips and tricks to help searchers find those videos. How PDS create their own videos to drive website traffic Terry has a well-trained voice and a background in video production. Sure, it helps, but despite his professional e, he says anyone can make a great video with the right tools, a creative idea, and a solid plan. For the beginner, Terry suggests . has a steep, but small, learning curve, and can e to HD without too much tweaking, and with a $20/month investment, it a low barrier to entry. If you using an Apple iOS device to shoot the video, then iMovie is an affordable editing tool that can handle 4K video at just $5 from the app store. A hard-drive based HD camera, decent microphone (they use a shotgun), some sort of LED-based lighting and a durable tripod, all of which can be gathered without breaking the bank. Plenty of videos are made with a phone camera for good reason. It cost effective and simple to operate, but we wanted PDS opinion on the viability of using one for marketing purposes. The consensus was that a phone camera and microphone are better than waiting until you have the gear. According to Terry, people often think they need the perfect camera to get started but then they shoot a video or two and hang it up because it too complicated a process. If using a phone camera is easy, use it but beware of the audio. As Terry pointed out it typically the audio quality that makes the video hard to watch. A microphone is important and if you looking for a good quality but low budget option, he suggests a for your phone. Once you have the proper tools, it a matter of combining creative ideas with a plan. As Terry points out, sounds simplistic, but it not. It true that anyone can shoot a video but that doesn mean people want to watch them. Great videos have purpose. Terry starts his creative process by answering these questions: why am I creating a video and what do we hope to accomplish? As Terry e, likes completions and most people will watch a one-minute video without even realizing they watched the whole thing. Statistics on backs this up with studies showing 2.7 minutes as our ma watch tolerance. Users viewing the entire video (also known as completions) are important for keyword search rankings on YouTube as well as Google. Completions drive SEO making them critical data point to track when you begin using videos in your marketing mix. Unlike written content, it difficult to skim a video so the entire production from beginning to end has to engage the watcher or you lose them. For that reason, videos should be short, to the point and entertaining. Creating a script helps organize thoughts and makes it easier to shoot the video because there a plan to follow. 200 words equates to appro one minute of video so aiming for that length is a good target. Creating a storyboard to visually mark the video flow results in a more cohesive production and helps reduce or eliminate any visible stops and starts. Once the script is set, use a storyboard to determine locations, scenes, acting direction, and camera angles. As Terry e, focus (no pun intended) is to validate the script to the video so the story makes visual sense. Tips and tricks to help channel partners create their own videos on a budget Think about involving the entire staff. Your video might be on a topic completely unrelated to your company culture but using staff as the cast members implies working together and having fun. This message, even though it not said, conveys that you a company people want to do business with. Use live video as opposed to images whenever possible. Sometimes images are necessary and if this is the case, use editing software to create effects like zooming and panning to give them movement. Terry points out that concentrating on having fun is key and don worry about over shooting, capture as much as you can, editing is your friend. Editing is a critical component to the success of the video but proceed with caution. Attention to detail is key. Think about the person watching. Use special effects, display your logo, and create an ending to each video that the same every time. PDS reminds watchers to visit their website, sign up for the newsletter and connect on social media at the close of each video. Another trick Terry suggested is to use music to cover echoes, pops (plosives), and other background noise. He says, offers a ton of royalty-free beds and loops easily found by searching for Audio Library.

Account Based Marketing is one of the latest hot trends for marketers and sales professionals. You can read a lot on that subject, but to me nothing is more revealing than a shopping e I had with my parents. A while ago, my seventy-something father was complaining about his feet hurting. Naturally, one needs comfortable shoes as one ages. With my mother in tow, off to Nordstrom we went, just in time for the semi-annual sale. Within 30 minutes the sales associate had my father in a high-quality, uber-comfortable pair of shoes. They were a bit pricey even with a ( sale discount, but necessary, and you can put a price on comfort. My father was happy. Mission accomplished. While my father was being attended to, my mother naturally did a bit of browsing, and I saw that the sales associate spied this. My parents are careful with their money and I could see my mother was taken aback by the prices, even with the sale. She not be buying. No way. Not at these prices. But what happened after the sales associate finished fitting my mother into a stylish yet comfortable pair of new shoes absolutely shocked me. Even more, the sales associate had my mother sign up with the credit card loyalty program to get coupons and points. After that, it seemed the majority of gifts I received from my parents were from Nordstrom! This episode forever changed my perspective on account-based marketing. Is account based marketing your key to increased sales? I have the opportunity to visit with our Xerox reseller partners pretty regularly, and as I listen I find there a common theme around selling more printers to more customers. I get it: who doesn want to grow their customer base? Yet, what about selling more to the customers they already have? Seems logical that it would be easier to sell more to a known entity: less effort, less cost. The Nordstrom sales associate understood this. She saw my parents as an account that had the potential to grow in future revenue (sales) with Nordstrom if they could be appropriately, , nurtured. She seized the opportunity to lobby my frugal mother to purchase a new pair of shoes, and though a tall order, she was successful. How? She hooked her with a Nordstrom credit card, which for the initial purchase brings an added discount to the sales price. She e that she earn reward points for her Nordstrom purchases that are redeemable for merchandise, and be placed on an mailing list so she learn of sales and special discounts for card holders. The result: the transaction is not the end truly the beginning. How does this story relate to printer sales? Selling a pair of shoes to my father is like selling a printer to an account. It essential for reseller partners to sell printers, just as it was the sales associate to sell a pair of shoes. While it starts with selling that first printer first pair of shoes it doesn end there. As Nordstrom got more (much more) from the initial shoe sale, so too can you get more sales from the account to which you initially sold the printer.

The result: we develop a clear view of what people are thinking. In my practice area, much of it revolves around document solutions. So if your role involves documents or document processes, I invite you to read on. For instance, I bet your IT spend is shrinking relative to your company growth as it is for most companies, which means you can readily invest in new systems or technologies like you have in the past. It pretty much maintenance mode, right? Or maybe your team is looking for ways to do more with less investment. An option so many are embracing is the cloud things onto scalable servers you don own or need to maintain. Sound familiar? Something else I know that you may not even have thought about yet, but you will: your document spending as a percentage of revenue. For most organizations it over 10 percent, when you factor in the full document lifecycle. Yeah, double digits. If you in healthcare, you spending about 15 percent of all the money coming in on documents and printing. Of course, it a cost of doing business. But what about customers, what about subscribers, what about patients? Shouldn more of your dollars be focused on delivering services to them? So, with all that revenue going toward documents and printing, yet the IT spending share going down, there ought to be a way to reconcile the two. Maybe free up some of the document-related spend to reinvest in technology. That where the concept of Managed Document and Print Services is taking hold in organizations across the U.S. and around the world. There are some megatrends that have come onto my radar. And I have to believe you seeing them, too. These are factors in your head but with no clear mandate as to what to do about them. In your emails and conference notes, I bet they called . Have any of these topics crossed your mind or your desk lately? want faster response times and more value for every dollar spent. as budgets decrease and competition increases, stakeholders e revenue to grow. It the only way to keep moving forward. looking everywhere to prevent costs from going up. Yet employees e modest raises. Healthcare costs increase. Raw materials rarely go down. There are few opportunities to save. industry has its own specifics, but risk and compliance are realities you can ignore. And they cost real money. Whether you directly manage IT or not, you no doubt familiar with these big drivers: company is investing in smartphones and tablets and also having to address employees bringing their own smartphones and tablets to work. You are looking for ways to manage and control all these new devices in a secure, productive and cost-effective way. The fact is, these mobile devices help employees to be more productive, so that a good thing, right? Sure, if you can manage it effectively. Security and printing from mobile devices are the two biggies to consider. you had a round of golf for every time you heard this word in 2013? Well, cloud use is growing fast and is beyond early adopter phase. It a smart way to save money and provide broad access to documents and apps. Again, security is a factor. Printing from the cloud is a factor. Finding cloud providers you can trust is a factor. your job? It everybody job now. You can ignore LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, FourSquare, Instagram, etc. Of course, no single person can keep up, but if you don have a strategy, you don have a chance. you reading this on an iPad or computer, you e the digital content e. If your team is generating blogs, tweets, articles and online videos, you contributing to the e. It a good thing, but it can be overwhelming and has big implications for document management and security. the cloud, big data may be the most talked about trend, with good reason. The promise of e data that helps us make smarter marketing decisions, down to dynamic pricing, has arrived. We hacking the genome in terms of customer data. It takes some serious computing power and dedicated analytics. How that shrinking IT budget working for you? You having to make tough choices between maintaining operations and new investments like this. Lots of opportunities if you tackle them right. And you could probably find a different partner to help you address every one of these trends. Truth is, though, every partner you have now those you consider in the future all be knowledgeable about these trends, and their offerings must work within these conte. They should all be able to help you address the changing business landscape in ways large and small. Most of the leading managed document and print service providers grew up in, well, digital printing. They have products that sit at the end of your network, providing hard copy and scanning. For years they were literally and figuratively . From that vantage point, however, they been able to see how work gets done in organizations large and small. One in particular has already transformed into a services provider, now with over half its revenue from services. That Xerox Corporation. The people, the know-how, have become even more valuable assets in the new marketplace than its strong technology. What does this mean for you?

Kurt Busch, one of the five Ford drivers to qualify for the 2017 playoffs finished fourth to give Ford a pair of top-ten Fusions. Logano and Clint Bowyer came into Saturday night season finale needing a win for playoff berth, but both fell short for different reasons. Logano ran in the top-10 most of the night and was able to work his way up to the top-three before his eventual runner-up finish. Bowyer suffered a pair of critical pit road penalties and had damage to the front end of his car in a bizarre incident with Matt Kenseth and an ambulance on pit road. Prior to that, Bowyer had run as high as second at one point and inside the top-15 for the bulk of the evening, even working himself from 33rd to 12th after the first pit road penalty early in the race. Despite Logano and Bowyer just missing out, Ford will have five drivers in the 10-week playoff run. Busch, Kevin Harvick, Brad Keselowski, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. and Ryan Blaney make up the Ford five which head to Chicagoland Speedway ne Sunday for the playoff opener. 1st - Kyle Larson 3rd - Ryan Newman 5th - Denny Hamlin - Erik Jones - Daniel Suarez - Jimmie Johnson - Kyle Busch - Chase Elliott 11 - Brad Keselowski - Kevin Harvick - Aric Almirola - Ryan Blaney - Ricky Stenhouse Jr. - Danica Patrick - Clint Bowyer - Trevor Bayne - David Ragan - Matt DiBenedetto - Landon Cassill came into the weekend saying second would be a failure and we finished second, so one spot short., overall, I proud of this team. came in here with the pressure on us and we e the best we could. scored some good stage points, which don mean anything, but it means we up front at least. just came up a little bit short there at the end. had a good restart. last run before that we short-pitted and we lost a lot of speed that run. whatever reason we lost all of our track position and fell out of the top five, and then just fought hard there at the end to try to make something happen., there was another caution. all but brought out a caution, but overall we got 10 races to go and we make it e for everyone that in the Playoffs when there is a car running for the win that out of it. be interesting for us. the end of our championship run, but it not the end of our season. still got a lot to race for. in the rearview mirror at this point. sting is over. nothing we can do about that at this point. just got to keep looking out the windshield and not the rearview mirror. is what it is. proud of the effort that we been able to give. was one of the best races we had in a long time, which is a good thing, but it was just one short. Fords are fast and now we finding this handling balance. really proud of everybody at SHR for working hard, knowing we were kind of going into unknown territory, but we got it switched over and thanks to Doug Yates, Haas Automation, Tony Stewart, Gene Haas, Monster Energy. been with me the last six years and it great to see them as the entitlement sponsor of our series, but it great to carry their logo on our car and have all of their vendors at the track. having a Monster time. in the Playoffs and now we gonna go e for these 10 weeks. doing everything right on the 41 car, and we can do better in some categories. long-run speed was really good tonight and that last green-white-checker I knew there was gonna be chaos. hope we end up getting fourth out of it. ran third tonight. missed it on the setup early on, making the wrong changes, and then we backed it up and, to be honest with you, I think we ended up with what we unloaded with Friday in this car right now, so those are some good signs heading into the Playoffs. poured everything in it after the off week and we did a lot of research to figure out where we were off a little bit, and I just happy with Ford and Monster Energy and with Haas everybody at Stewart-Haas just pushing to find more. can be complacent in this series. I look at a scoring pylon there are usually a couple of Toyotas ahead of us, but that Larson kid is good. won tonight and he got some more bonus points. how that went wrong. we have our stage breaks they usually have three or four yellow flag laps to control the field, and they opened up pit road way too soon there and there was an ambulance in the middle of pit road. because these stages are confusing race calls. , you get these late-race yellows and everybody puts tires on and you just kind of play the bonsai game and I got bonsaied, but that how it goes sometimes. been on the other end of that too. had a really fast Fitzgerald Glider Ford. in the race I thought we were gonna drive up and win it, and then the last two or three runs we just kind of lost the handle, but all in all a strong day. still looking for some rear downforce in the Fords. think if we had that, we might have had a shot at it, but, all in all, we ran solid and ran competitive, so that good. don think we anywhere close to where we need to be for the mile-and-a-halves, where the aero kicks in, but the short tracks we got Martinsville, which has been a real strong track for us, and then Talladega is a real strong track for us., we can just get solid finishes on the mile-and-a-halves and advance and find something to get on an equal playing field with the other manufacturer. were terrible all night. never got close to even being where we needed to be. last two weeks we started the race worse and fell off really bad. wish we were in a better spot performance-wise. just not running very good and we have to figure out how to run better. it gonna be a short 10 weeks. been a decent year for us. knew tonight was gonna be a struggle. is probably our worst race track and it been my worst race track my whole career. don know what I need to do, but that for a different day. think all of the races in the Playoffs we can go and do really good at. think the first round is pretty strong for us and Chicago has always been a fast race track for us, so hopefully we can start off with a strong showing and can have a good run to where we go to Loudon, which is probably our worst track in that little series. still run decent there, but I think the biggest thing is just not making mistakes, getting stage points and not messing up on pit road with speeding or things like that. don want silly things happening that kind of take you out of the first round because I think round two is really, really strong for us. are some really good tracks for us in there, but I proud to just be in it. nice to be a part of it with the Wood Brothers in my last year with them and hopefully we can have a good 10 weeks. gonna be fun. was pretty disappointing, actually. had high hopes coming in after a strong spring run here and we practiced well and qualified well, but just didn have it in the race. were points in the race where I thought we were OK, and then we took a gamble, pitted early and tried to jump some positions and it didn really pay off for us there. was a bummer of a night. wanted to have a little bit better of a night going into ne week at Chicago, but we take it and forget about it because ne week is a totally different week and a totally different race track, and I think it something that we looking forward to. just focused on making sure I don make mistakes. felt like tonight was a good night on that aspect. last couple of weeks I felt like we made some mistakes pit road, me driving so I felt like we accomplished a really good goal tonight of having a smooth, no-mistake race and that what we going to have to do come Chicago, Loudon and Dover. were trying a few little things tonight to look forward to Loudon, a short track in this first round, and I think we found some things not to bring back, so I guess that a positive to take out of it. , it is. I been at Roush Fenway since 2008, really 2007, and all the Chase and the Playoffs that Jack has been able to be a part of and to see us not a part of that over the last few years feels really good to be back. know it was always a pretty upbeat thing being around the shop, especially during the Playoffs, so I looking forward to the shop guys being able to enjoy it and being able to put a lot of effort into it. think the left rear tire was cut down or something like that. I am not really sure. We just hit the wall. It is really tough. We look forward to this race and then we didn even get a pit stop. Tough night. had a great car, usually when we can run in the top 25 through attrition and a mistake-free race we can run in the top 20, but there weren many cautions tonight and weren many guys wrecking. had a great car and raced with some good guys, but we tried to be aggressive with our strategy at the end and cost us four or five spots. just didn think we would run that many laps green, and those are calls that you got to be aggressive and make. they fall your way and sometimes they don, but I real proud of the speed we had in our car and it something we can learn from and hopefully finish the final 10 races strong. , you said it, came up a little bit short overall. Yeah, it stings a little bit. Last time we were sitting hereafter a race, it was after a win, and this time it's after a second, which overall if you look at our Richmond overall for a season with the two races, you'd say, that's pretty good, a first and a second. But just overall, obviously it stings to come up one spot short and not be able to get into the playoffs. It is what it is. It's reality, and we will move on. This is the test of our character, not only as a driver but as a team and the way we handle these ne 10 races. We don't want to roll over. We want to help our teammates try to win a championship, and ultimately we want to win 10 races. That's what the goal is at this point. It may be the end of our championship run this year, but it's not the end of our season. There's still a lot of races and a lot of stats we can rack up to make up for what still hurts right now. It is what it is. Like I said, we were close. I said before the race, second is a failure, and we finished second. Go figure. But overall, I'm proud of our race team, proud of the way we handled the pressure this week. I said before the race started that this is kind of like Homestead last year for us. It's just come a little bit early, so we knew how to handle these situations, and we e as good as we knew how to, just wasn't fast enough to make it happen when we needed to. 'm not in the playoffs. I mean, a successful season is winning the championship, and that's not going to happen this year. You know, can we win a bunch more races and call that success? Yeah, for that last 10 races, yeah, we'll be happy with that and we'll still celebrate victories, but the ultimate goal when we go down to Daytona every year for the first race is win the championship. That's all we talk about. We came up one spot short last year, and this year we came up one spot short just being in it. Yeah, it's a humbling sport. It's just how it is sometimes. We put ourselves in this position, and we'll live with it, and we'll fight hard to come back. want to win, right? Like I said, the goal for the last nine years has been to win the championship, and we keep getting close. This year we didn't, but in the past three, four years we've been in the hunt to make it happen. You know, to me is the pressure on to win one? I'm only 27, man. I've got a long ways to go in this deal, and I like the position that I'm in. I like the race team I'm with. You know, I think if you let your job define who you are, it would hurt a lot more, but I'm able to know that life is a lot bigger than just driving a race car, and I'm able to handle these situations a lot stronger as a man than just being a racer and that's it.""",ford,28,65,422.118,0.3,0.1,n,y,n,n,n,-0.0140303371,0.007403226,-0.0399732202,-0.0087572144,-0.0803716028,11981,1219,10.1744428679,55.68,y,n,y,y,n,2,5,3,1,4

Dyn provides critical DNS technology and services to the likes of Twitter, Amazon, Spotify and Netflix, all of whom saw disruptions from this botnet-based attack. In this case, a well-known strain of malware scanned the Internet of Things (IoT), searching for unsecured devices such as DVRs and IP-based cameras. The malware then hijacked the processing power and network connections of these devices to send continuous traffic to high profile websites, crippling their ability to keep up. If you are reading this, a device in your customer business may have unwittingly been part of this attack. The question many are now asking in the document management community is printers the ne target for this type of attack? Security has become a paramount concern for organizations large and small and must be a major priority for channel partners managing end-point devices. Whether it a printer or a router, we deploy and manage more end-point devices than ever before. As the Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing how we collect and process data from these devices, the devices themselves are becoming more and more vulnerable to determined hackers. IT managers can tell you that the enterprise is now full of devices that are not computers, but have processing power and are connected to the internet, making them ideal targets. But that doesn mean SMBs cannot reap the enormous benefits of IoT. Take, for e, the devices that make up SMB document management infrastructure inclusive of printers, scanners, copiers and that serve SMB document processing needs. On average, these document management devices make up as much as 15% of IT budgets of small to medium-size businesses (SMB) and demand as much as 12% of end-users total IT resources. These devices collect and retain valuable information on how documents flow within your customer organization. This represents information and connectivity that can be harnessed to make your customers businesses more efficient, and provide business opportunities for you. What is sometimes missed, however, is that these devices, just like smartphones and laptops, require the same type of end-point management and security processes as the rest of the IT infrastructure. With IT resources already stretched for most SMB customers, many are looking to channel partners and (MPS) as a way to not only secure their enterprise, but also optimize how they manage the devices they use for document processing. Managed print services represent a new way of managing and operating document infrastructure. In a managed environment, Xerox channel partners are responsible for all remote management, maintenance and optimization of document infrastructure. End-users know that printers, copiers, scanners and any other infrastructure associated with document management, are always up to date with the right hardware and software to get the job done and keep the business secure. But beyond just day-to-day device management, with managed print services, these devices communicate back to an operations center when critical supplies are needed to keep documents flowing within the organization. Toner is sent on-site in advance of need, when it is sensed that the printer is running low. Paper is ordered, or trays dynamically swapped to accommodate large print jobs. And technicians are dispatched immediately when devices are in need of service. This -wide management approach for all document processing, frees up valuable resources in the IT organization to focus on other issues, while still maintaining a real-time watch on the flow of document production. Multifunction printers enabled with ConnectKey Technology offer end-to-end scan & print encryption. At the heart of this intelligent document management infrastructure is technology. Xerox devices built on the ConnectKey architecture provide intelligent insight into resource usage and metrics, and can be managed remotely via agent software. The ConnectKey platform also supports the management of non-Xerox devices. In addition to device management, ConnectKey opens document infrastructure to mobile users, allowing them to print and access data from their smartphones or tablets. E this functionality into the cloud, printers can integrate directly via , box.net and Office365 so users can easily print documents residing on the most popular shared storage platforms directly from their mobile devices. A managed print approach delivers not only efficiency and cost savings to the end-user business, but significant security benefits as well. Many SMBs can keep up with the critical patching required to keep end-point devices such as printers secured across tens or hundreds of devices. With a channel partner managing this process, customers can be certain that all printers are updated with the latest patches, keeping them running efficiently and securely. Through a partnership with Cisco, ConnectKey-enabled devices integrate seamlessly with . This partnership allows Cisco and Xerox end-users to receive the benefits of 256-bit encryption with image overwrite features, secure print with time deletion and encrypted email connectivity between devices and e hosted email servers, allowing mobile users to print from their devices without the fear of transferring data over an unsecure network. This portfolio of functionality is at the center of the Xerox Cisco partnership, allowing Xerox MPS end-users to take advantage of Cisco Borderless Network Architecture. Today IT infrastructure provides both challenges and opportunities for SMBs. The dual levers of IT resources and budgets are strained like never before. More and more, channel partners are seeking alternatives for their customers to reduce costs, improve efficiencies and get more from their IT spending. secured with Cisco security technology provides a force multiplier to SMBs, reducing cost, protecting confidential data and e the resources available to focus on the strategic business of IT.
