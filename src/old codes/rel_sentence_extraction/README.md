## Aim
To identify the important sentences of a document which needs to be annotated for the sentence ranking task. Here, we consider the sentences selected by at least one of the different summarization algorithms, to be marked as importamt.

## Files 
The text summarization codes are obtained from [https://github.com/icoxfog417/awesome-text-summarization](https://github.com/icoxfog417/awesome-text-summarization). We modified it and used for our experiments.

1. Lexicons : Contains the Emotion Lexicons files used to computing the "Polarity" aspect of a sentence (we use the VADER tool of nltk for our case). The NRC Emotion lexicons are obtained from this [website](https://www.saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm).

2. Three types of summarization algorithms implemented here - (a) text-based (b) feature-based (c) topic-based. We provide both the raw files as well as the Jupyter Notebooks.
