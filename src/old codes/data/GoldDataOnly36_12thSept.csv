This is technology that does something for you - it makes you better."" ;Each of the series of products incorporates the following technology specifications to ensure optimal on-field performance during the game or practice:;The ""Click-Clack"" campaign began nearly a year ago during Under Armours renowned PROTECT THIS HOUSE television advertising campaign where viewers got a first glimpse of what was to come from Under Armour with the sound of cleats on concrete leading onto a football field. Since then, Under Armour has rolled out a series of print advertising campaigns in ESPN The Magazine that have revealed only snippet views of the cleats.

"b'http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/blog/whole-story/frans-chocolates'","wholefoodsmarket","b' By Denise Breyley, May 3, 2012 | As the Pacific Northwest Local Forager, discovering new products and producers is certainly fun and a huge part of my job. But sometimes it even more fun to -discover an old favorite. isn just a classic local product. It a local and national treasure, too. Fran Bigelow opened her original Seattle store, Fran Patisserie & Chocolate Specialties, in 1982, focusing on freshly baked pastries and cakes. Her move toward confections began gradually; if you were lucky enough to be one of the early customers, you were often treated to a free chocolate truffle while waiting in line to purchase baked goods. Yum! Today, Fran Chocolates are known and loved far beyond the Pacific Northwest. She been featured on the Food Network and in newspapers around the country. When President Barack Obama was on the campaign trail four years ago, he discovered her legendary Smoked Salt Caramels and went bonkers for them. Now, special visitors to the White House receive a box of the salted caramels stamped with the Presidential Seal as a parting gift half in milk chocolate (The President favorite) and half in dark chocolate (First Lady Michelle preference). And of course, you can find Fran Chocolates in Whole Foods Market stores throughout the US. Since Fran marks 30 years of producing one-of-a-kind sweets on June 1 of this year, I took a tour of their production kitchens with CEO Andrina Bigelow, Fran daughter, to learn just what makes them so special. Hue (shown here) has been part of Fran for 19 years, and in the early years it was just Fran and Hue tying the ribbons on each box. Today Hue is the supervisor of packing and is still giving each box of chocolates that special touch. The quality of the product on the inside is matched by the presentation. I found the secret to Fran success can be boiled down to the highest quality ingredients; unwavering attention to detail with a focus on taste; and hiring and nurturing a talented team. I could see these principles demonstrated everywhere I looked on my tour, and it no surprise to me that they been going strong for as long as they have. Here to 30 more years!
